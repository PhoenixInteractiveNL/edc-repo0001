UI: This simulation is now throttled in full-screen mode.
CPU: Implemented TDC instruction in 65C816 mode.
CPU: Implemented undocumented $93 (SHA) and $BB (LAS) opcodes.
CPU: Fixed flags on $9C (SHY) opcode.
CPU: Removed bogus 65C816 opcode ($DC) in 6502 decoder.
Cassette: Fixed desync between audio and data after accelerated load.
Cassette: Audio/data channels are no longer swapped when processing stereo input.
Cassette: Raised cutoff on control line low-pass filter to fix reliability problems at turbo baud rates.
Cassette: Fixed incorrect SIO return code for accelerated cassette reads.
Cartridge: Fixed MMU mapper so that the cartridge ROM now overrides BASIC at $A000-BFFF.
Cartridge: TRIG3 is now deasserted when $A000-BFFF is unmapped.
Cartridge: The second bank setting for Bounty Bob Strikes Back! cartridges is now saved in save states.
Disk: Added support for weak bit emulation in VAPI images.
Disk: Fixed VAPI image read errors when missing sectors are present.
Disk: Fixed incorrect FDC status when loading long sectors that set the "lost data" status bit.
Disk: SIOV/DSKINV acceleration handlers set more kernel variables for better compatibility.
Disk: Abort acceleration attempt when disk buffer contains SIO timeout flag (TIMFLG).
Disk: Adjusted sector read delay to increase VAPI image compatibility.
Disk: Fixed cases where the virtual read/write setting was not obeyed properly.
GTIA: Changes to GRAFPx/GRAFM are latched and no longer affect a sprite image that is already shifting out.
GTIA: Increased timing precision of console speaker from 28 cycles to single cycle.
GTIA: Fixed bug that caused some apps to misdetect the video mode as SECAM.
GTIA: Adjusted timing for mid-screen changes to P/M graphics and color registers.
GTIA: CONSOL output bit 3 wasn't affecting input bit 3.
GTIA: VDELAY now masks DMA fetches rather than actually delaying loads.
POKEY: Fixed random crash in stereo mode.
POKEY: 15KHz and 64KHz clocks are no longer joined between the left and right channel chips.
POKEY: The channels now have the correct 0-3 clock skew for reading the noise generators.
POKEY: Implemented channel 1/2 inversion when not in volume-only mode.
POKEY: Implemented non-linear mixing.
POKEY: Audio plays again when initialization mode is active.
POKEY: Implemented serial force break bit (SKCTL bit 7) affecting two-tone mode.
POKEY: STIMER now resets output channel states properly.
POKEY: Asynchronous serial input mode now holds down timers 3 and 4 again when a byte is not shifting in.
HLE: The math pack is now emulated even if the acceleration option is disabled.
HLE: POTGO is now strobed during vertical blank stage 2 processing.
HLE: STRIG2/3 are now updated from TRIG0/1 instead of TRIG2/3 for XL/XE hardware compatibility.
HLE: Fixed bug where POKEY was put into initialization mode after an unaccelerated SIO transfer.
HLE: POKEY audio channels are now shut off after an SIO operation.
HLE: Added keyboard click.
ANTIC: Two-line resolution mode now reloads GTIA every scan line.
ANTIC: Fixed timing when using read-modify-write instructions to trigger WSYNC.
Simulator: Memory banking wasn't updated properly on changes to the port B data direction register.
