What's New in this version?
---------------------------

30 Sep 2012 - version 1.1
- a22i: assembler sample source code found in magicnes.zip (on nocash webpage)
- a22i: assembler includes .pc10_xxx directives for generating PC10 games
- a22i: assembler supports formulas with brackets, ALU ops and boolean stuff
- arcade: emulates PC10 with Z80 CPU and either secondary monitor or 4-digit LED
- arcade: emulates VS Unisystem (ppu/palettes, special lightgun variant, etc.)
- arcade/hotelbox: rougly emulates famicombox (menu only, without games yet)
- controllers: support PC gamepads (button config, analog inputs, etc)
- controllers: optionally emulates 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 joypads (both NES and famicom)
- controllers: support for about 30 different special controllers and add-ons:
   - none
   - auto (by ROM checksum)
   - two keyboard variants
   - pointing devices (mouse, trackball)
   - three lightgun variants (zapper, hypershot, vs-system)
   - all the paddle variants (old and new famicom versions, and nes version)
   - oeka kids tablet, power pad dance mat and tap-tap mat
   - push-buttons (hypershot, party-tap, mahjong controller)
   - analog controllers (power glove, uforce, pachinko, racermate bicycle)
   - piano keyboards (miracle, doremikko)
   - barcode readers (battler and datach)
   - inflatable controllers (boxing bag, top-rider bike)
   - storage devices (battle box and turbofile)
   - arcade/hotelbox (coin inputs, rotating-switch, dip switches, etc.)
   - multitaps (implied in number of joypads option) (nes and famicom variants)
- help: full specs on all of the above newly emulated controllers
- help: full specs on further add-ons (r.o.b., data recorder, 3d glasses)
- help: full specs on PC10, VS System, FamicomBox
- gui: file menu: memorizes recent_files, and this or that other new detail
- fixed battery backed sram saving (uses cartname.sav instead xxxx.sav)
- debug: always executes illegal opcodes (even when warn-on-bad-stuff enabled)
- speedup: suppresses freshen_video when rewriting -same- CHR-bank values
- timing: uses 1024hz mmtime (smoother than 18Hz timer) (more CPU load though)
- sound: optionally dummy stereo mode (for bugged Win98-Realtek-VIA mono-driver)
- bugfix: MMC3 TQROM (mapper 119) emulates CHR-ROM/CHR-RAM selection
- bugfix: MMC3 TLSROM (mapper 118) NT-select by bit7 of CHR-bank numbers
- bugfix: Tengen RAMBO-1 (thanks scott nash for bugreport, kevtris for specs)
- emu: cpu emulates all stable undoc opcodes, smaller read-modify I/O handlers
- help/emu: dummy VRAM fetch on palette reads (stored in Port 2007h latch)
- emu: emulates corrected MMC1 nametable stuff (required for R.C. Pro-Am PRG1)
- help: added info on MMC1 E000h/Bit4, corrected MMC1 nametable BLK0/BLK1 info
- emulation: fine-adjusted PAL cycles per scanline (106.56 instead 106.53)
- help: corrected PAL clocks (osc/16=1.66MHz=50Hz instead osc/15=1.77MHz=53Hz)
- help: corrected nocash sram circuit exchanged Q0-3 and D0-3 on 74173
- help: added "Nocash syntax:" notes to each CPU opcode description
