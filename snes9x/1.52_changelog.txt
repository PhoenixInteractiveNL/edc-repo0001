Snes9x 1.52
- IMPORTANT NOTICE: The structure of savestates (also known
  as snapshots / freeze files) is incompatible with older
  versions! Snes9x 1.52 cannot read the savestates created
  by 1.51 or older.                                         (zones)
- Highly acculate SPC700 and S-DSP emulation.               (Blargg)
- Replaced APU emulation cores (SPC700 and S-DSP) with
  ones provided by Blargg's SNES_SPC library. This renders
  savestates incompatible with older versions.              (BearOso, zones)
- SPC7110 emulation.                                        (byuu, neviksti)
- Merged bsnes' SPC7110 emulation code. Note that the .rtc
  file of Far East of Eden Zero is incompatible with older
  versions.                                                 (zones)
- Removed graphics pack support. It's no more necessary.    (zones)
- Replaced S-RTC emulation code with bsnes' one to keep the
  good compatibility of .rtc files between the two
  emulators. As a result, Daikaijuu Monogatari 2 now
  outputs the .rtc file, and its .srm file is incompatible
  with older versions.                                      (zones)
- Added savestate supports for DSP-2, DSP-4, ST-010 and
  OBC1.                                                     (zones)
- Added UPS support.                                        (byuu)
- Fixed DSP-4 AI problem.                                   (Jonas Quinn)
- Fixed invalid memory accesses in C4 and OBC1 codes.       (zones)
- Fixed invalid memory accesses in BSX codes. My mistake.   (zones)
- Fixed the read value of $213e, $4210 and $4211.           (zones)
- Fixed the writing of word values at the memory boundary.  (zones)
- Fixed the bug that the unnecessary SA-1 emulation
  continues once any SA-1 games are launched.               (zones)
- Removed old color blending codes.                         (zones)
- Removed too-old Snes96 and ZSNES snapshot support.        (zones)
- Updated command-line options.                             (zones)
- Code cleaning.                                            (zones)
- GTK+ : Added a port of Snes9x to the GTK+ toolkit.        (BearOso)
- Unix : Reconstructed and simplified all the contents.
  Some features have been removed to be simple, and many
  options have changed. GTK+ port is recommended for most
  of Linux users.                                           (zones)
- Win32: Now uses snes9x.conf to prevent problems with
  modified meaning of settings.                             (OV2)
- Win32: Removed broken OpenGL mode.                        (OV2)

  new APU core and display settings.                        (OV2)
- Win32: Updated defaults to use D3D and XA2 (better
  Vista and Win7 support).                                  (OV2)
- Win32: Direct3D and XAudio2 support.                      (OV2)
- Win32: Added Blargg's ntsc filter (three presets).        (OV2)
