- HDMA Indirect Address fix for Romancing Saga 2            (anomie)
- Better savestate hack, does it break anything?            (anomie)
- C4 C core fixes. Mostly Trapezoid (thanks Nach),
  some s/short/int16/, some indentation.                    (anomie)
- Damn, but the indentation in ppu.cpp was screwed up.
  Killed some dead code too (twas commented forevermore).   (anomie)

- Hack for Moryou Senki Madara 2, don't call
  SelectTileRenderer from DrawOBJS if BGMode is 5 or 6. A
  real fix requires at least rewriting SelectTileRenderer,
  or inlining a special version in DrawOBJS.                (anomie)

  screen height accordingly. Other ports are still broken.  (anomie)
- Unix/X11: Fixed possible TV mode crash.                   (anomie)

- Unix/X11: Fixed OpenGL target                             (PBortas)
