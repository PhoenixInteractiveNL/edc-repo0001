What's New in this version?
---------------------------

This is the first public release of the Windows version of z26.

The assembly language emulator core is now pure 32-bit code.

There are new windowed video modes.

The GUI is gone for now.  It will probably come back later.

Many smaller changes are discussed in this document (readme.txt).
