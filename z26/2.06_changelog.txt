What's New in this version?
---------------------------

Games running in windowed modes now grab the mouse and make the cursor
disappear. So now games are as easy to control with the mouse in a
window as they are when running full screen.

Performance in windowed video modes has been improved and the size
of the windows has been shrunk to fit the game, particularly in the
narrow aspect ratios.

A new aspect ratio has been added (-e2) which is closer to an authentic
aspect ratio in the larger windowed modes (-v13 through -v18).

Added a new phosphorescent effect that allows 30Hz blinking effects to
appear without blinking. This allows games with 30Hz effects like Yars
Revenge or Stellar Track to run in a window without the visual artifacts
that normally occur when the display is not synchronized with the game.
This effect is specified with the -fN command line switch. The parameter
is the frame mixing coefficient (0 through 100) which specifies how much
the bright pixel is favored over the dim pixel when mixing the value of
two frames. The default is 77. If you specify a value greater than 100
or less than zero, the effect is disabled for games that are
automatically recognized as needing this effect, like Yars Revenge.

Some additional full screen modes have been added (-v20 through -v28)
which have the same number of bits per pixel as the current desktop.
This was done to allow the phosphorescent effect to run in full screen
video modes.
