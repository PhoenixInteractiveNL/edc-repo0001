What's New in this version?
---------------------------

Changed the Extended Tigervision (-g11) bankswitch scheme to keep the 
last bank fixed.  All rom images that are bigger than 64K and not a 
multiple of 8448 now default to this scheme.

The original Tigervision (-g4) bankswitch scheme now also supports up to
512K games but with $1800-$1FFF as the fixed bank.  This allows compatibility
with the Cuttle Cart for games up to 64K in size.

Rom images that *are* a multiple of 8448, i.e. Supercharger games, are
now supported in sizes up to 61 loads.


Thanks to Andrew Davie for providing a 512K ROM for testing!
