What's new in version 2.13?
    *    Converted MASM assembly code to NASM syntax, preparatory to the...

    *    ...Linux port! z26 can now be compiled for Windows, Linux, or just
         about any other x86 environment that supports a UNIX-like build
         environment with GCC. The Linux support is solid; preliminary
         testing has been done on FreeBSD and BeOS. There are a few
         Linux-specific command-line options, see below. A Linux static
         binary is available for those who don't wish to compile z26 from
         source.

    *    Improved documentation. We now have a PDF manual and a man page for
         Linux.

    *    Added ability to selectively disable graphical objects. This
         feature is mostly intended for developers.

    *    We now lock the audio device before filling the sound queue. This
         should prevent the long startup times that were plaguing some
         Windows users. It also should allow z26 to run correctly on
         multi-processor machines.

    *    Also we made the INTIM timer random at the emulator start again.
         Berzerk should start with a different screen each time you play it
         now.

    *    Other than the audio device locking and the random INTIM timer,
         version 2.13 for Windows should behave identically to version 2.12.
         If this isn't the case, please let us know.

    *    Thanks to Brian Watson, Eckhard Stolberg, and James Wilkinson for
         help with this version!
