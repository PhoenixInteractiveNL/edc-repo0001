What's New in this version?
---------------------------

Made mouse capture in windowed modes optional. It is controlled with the
-MN command line switch. N=0 is off, N=1 is on. It is on by default.

We now make a distinction between upper case and lower case letters in
command line switches.  There are now many more possibilities.

Many more games automatically run with phosphorescence turned on when
running in a window.
