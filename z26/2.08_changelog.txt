What's New in this version?
---------------------------

Added support for USB and other Direct-X controllers. Support is
automatic and you may use up to two controllers. They must be the first
in your controller list that comes up under your Windows game controller
setup.

A new PAL palette based on a PAL screen capture provided by Oliver
Achten.

Screen capture to .bmp files supported so that you can capture screens
of games that are running with the phosphorescent effect. Use the -B
command line switch to enable .bmp captures.

FE bankswitching is implemented as flat model again.

Added Midnight Magic to the list of phosphorescent games.

Thanks to Eckhard Stolberg for help with this version!
