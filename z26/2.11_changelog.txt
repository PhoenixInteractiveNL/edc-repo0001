What's New in this version?
---------------------------

A fix to the sound to allow Andy Mucho's pitsound.bin to play.

TIA sound polynomials adapted to better match Adam Wozniak's descriptions.

Added -R command line switch to synchronize game to sound card.  This helps
games that use digital sound like quadrun and some recent demos.  You also get
closer to an exact 60 fps when playing NTSC games this way.

Thanks to Eckhard Stolberg for help with this version!
