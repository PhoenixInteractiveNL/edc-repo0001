What's new in Gens/GS v2.15.5/GS-m5.2?

Milestone 5.2 introduces the following new features:

- Updates to the most-used renderers:

  - The C++ 1x, 2x, and 2x scanline renderers are now much faster.

  - The asm and mmx 1x and 2x renderers have been updated to support
    32-bit color.

  - The scanline and interpolated scanline asm renderers now correctly
    black out empty lines, which fixes a "leftover garbage" problem
    caused by the new text drawing function.

- [Linux] The OpenGL renderer now supports border color emulation.

- The "Stretch" option now allows you to set Horizontal Stretch and
  Vertical Stretch independently.

- New "General Options" window layout. The new layout takes up a lot less
  space than the old layout, and allows for more options.

- The "General Options" window now allows you to enable or disable
  border color emulation and the pause tint.

- [GTK+] The design of the "Controller Configuration" window has been
  improved.

Milestone 5.2 has the following miscellaneous changes:

- The "BIOS/Misc Files" entries for "GCOffline" and "Gens Manual" have been
  removed. There are no functions in Gens/GS that make use of these, and both
  documents haven't been updated in several years.

- The 16 kHz, 32 kHz, and 48 kHz sound rates have been removed. They never
  worked properly and ended up causing lag.

- The built-in debugger now sleeps for 100 ms between frames. Previously, it
  would attempt to redraw frames as fast as possible, which led to high CPU
  usage if VSync wasn't turned on.

- [Win32] hq2x is broken, so it has been disabled for now.	

Milestone 5.2 fixes the following bugs:

- Fixed compilation with --disable-cdrom.

- Fixed some PWM regressions introduced in m5.1.

- [Win32] Savestates were sometimes not saved to the correct directory.

Milestone 5.2 has the following low-level code changes:

- VDraw_DDraw: CORRECT_256_ASPECT_RATIO and ALT_X_RATIO_RES have been removed.
  These were originally used in Gens Rerecording to specify if the horizontal
  resolution should always be stretched, but is no longer necessary due to the
  improved "Stretch" mode options.

- nasm now generates debugging symbols for all asm code.

- Many functions and variables that don't need global visibility have been
  marked as static.

- New CPU flag system to determine all available instruction sets instead of
  just MMX. This will allow for more optimizations later on.

- Fixed an issue where a segment override prefix was specified in Starscream,
  which broke Valgrind. (Valgrind is still broken for SegaCD and 32X emulation,
  unfortunately.)
