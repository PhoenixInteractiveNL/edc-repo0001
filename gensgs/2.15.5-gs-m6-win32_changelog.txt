What's new in Gens/GS v2.15.5/GS-m6?

Milestone 6 introduces the following new features:

- Mega Drive Plugins v0.1.0. The initial version of the plugin system
  only supports render plugins and only if they're built into the
  main executable. A later version will add support for external
  plugins (.dll on Windows, .so on Linux), as well as more types of
  plugins, such as netplay, debugging, and movie recording.

- doc/MDP.txt contains the MDP Interface Specifiction Version 0.1.0.

- All renderers now support 32-bit color.

- [Win32] hq2x has been fixed.

- Scale2x now has optimized C and x86 mmx implementations.

- New renderers: Scale3x, Scale4x, hq3x, hq4x.

- Added a 32-bit color asm version of the Fast Blur effect, with mmx
  optimizations if available.

Milestone 6 fixes the following bugs:

- [SDL] Ctrl+Q did not work in fullscreen mode.

Milestone 6 has the following low-level code changes:

- Many x86 assembler files have been cleaned up. In particular, many of them
  no longer depend on the "nasmhead.inc" macro file. This macro file provided
  alignment macros (which nasm has built-in) and "DECL" macros, which provide
  both underscored and non-underscored symbol declarations. Only one of these
  is needed per symbol, and it depends on architecture. Removing "DECL" and
  manually redefining symbols reduced the total symbol count.

- Adjusted alignment values for many x86 asm functions.

- Added alpha transparency support to ImageUtil::writePNG().

- Major overhaul for the ImageUtil::writeBMP() code. Changes include using
  a templated function for different color depths, using pointer arithmetic
  instead of recalculating array indexes for every iteration, and fixing a
  bug that caused bitmaps to be 54 bytes larger than they should have been.

- The "Render Fullscreen" and "Render Windowed" values in the gens.cfg file
  now contain the renderer tag instead of an ID number. For example, instead
  of saying "1" for the Normal renderer, the value would be "Normal".
