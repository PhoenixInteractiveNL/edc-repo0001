What's new in Gens for Linux v2.15.2/GS-m2?

Milestone 2 introduces the following new features:

- PNG screenshot support via libpng. This was apparently a wishlist item
  for Gens for the past several years, but no one bothered to add it.

- Screenshots now save the unfiltered image at the correct resolution.
  For example, Sonic CD special stages now save as a 256x224 image.

- Rewrite of the way compressed files are handled. Compressed files are
  now handled using a generic COMPRESS_Handler interface. Currently, only
  GZip and Zip files are supported (the same as before), but it's now
  much easier and simpler to add new formats.

- The new compression handler detects compressed files by checking the
  file's header instead of relying on the file's extension. This may help
  in cases where a file is misnamed.

- Multi-file Zip support. If a Zip file containing multiple files is
  selected, Gens will prompt you to select which file to open. The UI
  for selecting a file is currently not polished, but it will be improved
  later on.

- Rewrite of the way renderers are handled. The new rendering system uses
  the same rendering code, but has a much simpler calling interface.

- Initial 32-bit color support, ported from Gens Rerecording. Most of the
  32-bit color renderers haven't been ported from Gens Rerecording yet,
  so only three are available in 32-bit: Normal, Double, and Scale2x.
  15-bit or 16-bit color is necessary for the others. To change color modes,
  select Graphics, Bits Per Pixel, and the appropriate color mode.

- Conditional compilation support for OpenGL, PNG, and x86 asm renderers.
  If PNG support is not enabled, screenshots will be taken in BMP format.

- Border color emulation. The border color is set to color 0 of palette 0
  from the MD's VDP.

Milestone 2 fixes the following bugs:

- Fixed a bug where the 32X VDP overlay disappeared when Gens was paused via
  the Escape key. The overlay reappeared when Gens was unpaused, though.
