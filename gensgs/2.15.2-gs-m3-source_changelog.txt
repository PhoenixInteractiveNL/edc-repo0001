What's new in Gens for Linux v2.15.2/GS-m3?

Milestone 3 introduces the following new features:

- Completely rewritten video rendering subsystem. The new video rendering
  subsystem abstracts the differences between plain SDL and SDL+OpenGL
  and presents a standard interface to the rest of Gens. This will make
  it easier to add in DirectDraw support later on.

- The configuration file handler has been rewritten such that it no longer
  fails to read or write certain configuration entries. Additionally,
  section names and key names are now case-insensitive.

- The OpenGL renderer now supports 15-bit and 32-bit color modes.

- Improved Fast Blur function, written in C, that supports 15, 16, and 32-bit
  color modes. The old Fast Blur function is still used for 15 and 16-bit color
  if x86 asm is enabled via --enable-x86-asm in the ./configure script.

- 7z archives can now be used via an external 7z binary. You must have
  p7zip installed in order to use this feature.

- SegaCD LED code has been updated to work correctly in all color modes.

Milestone 3 fixes the following bugs:

- The built-in debugger now properly updates the screen in 32-bit color.

- Horizontal positioning for 256x224 video modes in 32-bit color was off
  by 32 pixels.

Milestone 3 has the following low-level code changes:

- Standard controller I/O functionality has been ported to C. Additionally,
  controller button presses are now stored in bitfields rather than reserving
  an entire 32-bit int per button. Unfortunately, I could not figure out how
  to port over the TeamPlayer code correctly, so that remains in x86 asm for
  now, with compatibility wrappers with regards to the button format.

- Compression handlers have been rewritten using C++ classes.

- C++ code has been introduced into the Gens/GS codebase. With this change,
  all header files have been updated to include "#ifdef __cplusplus"
  barriers, so older C-only code will link correctly.
