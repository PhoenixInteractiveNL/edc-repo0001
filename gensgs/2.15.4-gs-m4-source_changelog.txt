What's new in Gens for Linux v2.15.4/GS-m4?

Milestone 4 introduces the following new features:

- The SegaCD GFX debugger now shows all 16 virtual palette lines. The
  virtual palette lines include highlight and shadow. Previously, these
  lines were selectable, and the patterns did reflect the palettes, but
  the color lines didn't actually show up.

- MAME CHD and CCnet support have been removed. They weren't used for
  anything and simply took up extra space.

- OpenGL linear filtering can now be enabled/disabled via a menu item.

- New generic input and audio layers, which are located in src/gens/input/
  and src/gens/audio/. Like VDraw, which was implemented in Milestone 3,
  this will make it easier to add support for DirectInput and DirectSound,
  respectively. src/gens/sdllayer/ is now completely gone.

- New onscreen text drawing function. The new function draws text to the
  display framebuffer rather than to the emulated framebuffer. Among other
  things, this means that messages and the FPS counter no longer show up
  in screenshots. The font currently used is the Commodore 64 font, but
  more fonts may be added later on.

- 32-bit color support in the VDP debugger.

- Improved OpenGL renderer. The improved renderer takes some fixes from
  Gens/Linux 2.15.4, as well as improving the VSync functionality. VSync
  uses GLX_SGI_swap_control extension, so it may not work on all systems.
  Support for other VSync extensions will be added later on.

Milestone 4 fixes the following bugs:

- Shadow/Highlight colors were incorrect in 16-bit color.

- If the country code was set to US, Gens would incorrectly attempt to
  load the EU MegaCD BIOS if a SegaCD game was loaded, resulting in a
  region coding error. This has been fixed.

- Physical CD-ROM support via ASPI works again. I accidentally broke it
  when CD-ROM support was made conditional.

Milestone 4 has the following low-level code changes:

- C99 mode is now used by default for C-language code.

- The new INI handler has been converted to a C++ class.

- Deprecated GTK+ functions have been disabled via the
  -DGTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED CFLAG.

- New GensUI C++ class, which replaces the old ui-common.c and
  ui-common_gtk.c files.

- Minizip has been upgraded to the latest version (v1.01e) and is now in
  a separate subdirectory in src/.
