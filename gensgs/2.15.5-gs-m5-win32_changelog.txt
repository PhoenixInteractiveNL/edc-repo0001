What's new in Gens/GS v2.15.5/GS-m5?

Milestone 5 introduces the following new features:

- The Windows UI and DirectX code has been integrated into the codebase.
  The Gens/GS codebase can now be used to compile both the Linux versions
  and the Windows versions.

- [Linux] The frame counter code has been updated to work a lot better.
  In particular, it no longer uses the x86 instruction "rdtsc", so it
  should be more accurate on multiprocessor and multicore systems.

- 7z: A warning dialog is now shown if the 7z binary cannot be run. This
  usually occurs if 7-Zip isn't installed.

- [GTK+] The "General Options" dialog now has regular buttons instead of
  radio buttons for selecting colors. It seems that most GTK+ themes don't
  properly support changing the colors of radio buttons, so changing them
  to regular buttons enables proper color support.

Milestone 5 fixes the following bugs:

- [32X] PWM audio volume has been increased by a factor of 4, making it audible.

- [SegaCD] The 8th PCM audio channel now works.

- [Linux] If Gens is started in a terminal window, Ctrl-C now correctly
  shuts down the program. Earlier versions ignored Ctrl-C. Apparently,
  SDL catches the Ctrl-C (SIGINT) and adds it to the SDL event queue as
  an SDL_QUIT message.

- The "Save Config" and "Load Config As" functions incorrectly passed a
  NULL value to the GensUI class when a C++ string was expected, resulting
  in a crash.

- Clicking "OK" in the "Archive File Selection" dialog with no file selected
  resulted in a crash.

- [32X] Some 32X ROMs were misdetected as Genesis ROMs. In particular, drx's
  "Sonic 32X" does not say "SEGA 32X" in the header. However, the ROM does
  have "MARS" at 0x040E. The detection function has been updated to take
  this into account, so "Sonic 32X" is now properly detected as a 32X ROM.

- [GTK+] Fixed GTK+ 2.4 compatibility issues.

- [GTK+] Added accelerators for the "Cancel" and "Save" buttons in the
  Game Genie window.

Milestone 5 has the following low-level code changes:

- -Wl,--as-needed has been added to LDFLAGS. This eliminates unnecessary
  library dependencies.

- Internal copies of zlib and libpng have been added. These internal copies
  are not used by default on the Linux build, since most Linux systems have
  zlib and libpng already installed, but are used by default on the Windows
  build. Use of these internal copies can be configured using the ./configure
  script.

- MP3 playback support can now be disabled in the ./configure script.

- rom.cpp, save.cpp, and imageutil.cpp (formerly scrshot.c) have been
  converted to static C++ classes.

- The INI parser now supports hexadecimal and octal numbers. These numbers
  are identified by prefixes. (Hexadecimal: "0x" or "0X"; Octal: "0".)
  
- Controller mappings are now saved as hexadecimal numbers in gens.cfg.

Milestone 5 has the following known issues:

- [Win32] MP3 support is currently disabled due to problems with the MP3
  library. ASPI support is available though, so you can use an ASPI library
  with a CD-ROM emulator, such as Daemon Tools.

- [Win32] Stretched rendering may not work properly in fullscreen mode.

- [Linux] Monaural sound is broken.
