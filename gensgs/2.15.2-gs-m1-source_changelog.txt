What's new in Gens for Linux v2.15.2/GS-m1?

Milestone 1 introduces the following new features:

- Massive code cleanup throughout the entire Gens codebase. Many
  functions with duplicated code have been consolidated so that
  the duplicated code is now shared between the functions. Also,
  several large files have been split into smaller files. For instance,
  gens.c has been split into gens.c, g_md.c, g_mcd.c, g_32x.c,
  and g_palette.c.

- Introduction of OS-independent functions, which will allow for the
  integration of the Win32 version of Gens later on, so that one codebase
  can be used to build a Gens executable for either operating system.

- Gens v7 savestate format, ported from Gens Rerecording. This adds,
  among other things, proper Sega CD savestate support.

- Fixed the built-in debugger, which was broken due to changes in
  the way text was written to the emulated screen.

- Added enhanced Sega CD GFX debugging from Gens Rerecording.

- VDP/GFX debugging now outlines the selected palette.

- Initial attempt to consoldidate global variables into structs.
  This will make it easier to figure out where everything is located.

- Complete rewrite of the GTK+ UI. Among other things, the new UI
  has much improved synchronization, so when a menu item is checked,
  it actually means that item is enabled.
  
- Rewrite of the byteswapping functions so that they describe what is
  being swapped (e.g. be16_to_cpu_array()).

- Extra spaces in game names in ROM headers are removed when the
  game name is displayed on Gens' title bar.
  
- Fixed tons of compiler warnings.
