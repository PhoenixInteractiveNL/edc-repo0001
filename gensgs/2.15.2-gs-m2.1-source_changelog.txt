What's new in Gens for Linux v2.15.2/GS-m2.1?

Milestone 2.1 fixes the following bugs:

- 32X VDP rendering was accidentally broken completely in m2. It's fixed
  now, at least for 15-bit and 16-bit color. 32-bit color mode still needs
  to be fixed.

- The window title for 32X games was always set to "32X (PAL)", even if
  the game is NTSC. This is fixed.
