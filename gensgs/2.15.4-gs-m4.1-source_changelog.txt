What's new in Gens for Linux v2.15.4/GS-m4.1?

Milestone 4.1 introduces the following new features:

- The Fast Forward feature has been re-enabled. It is mapped to F1.
  Note that Fast Forward doesn't work if VSync is enabled.

Milestone 4.1 fixes the following bugs:

- SDL's joystick handler wasn't being initialized properly. Joysticks
  were properly detected in the Controller Configuration window, but
  didn't work in-game. This bug was reported by Techokami in #retro.

- A missing #include <stdlib.h> line has been added to g_main_linux.hpp.
  Lack of this line led to compilation failures on some machines.
  This bug was reported by SOTI in #retro.

- zlib support can now be conditionally compiled. This only affects the
  GZip and Zip functionality; PNG support implies zlib, but enabling PNG
  support will not implicitly enable zlib support.
