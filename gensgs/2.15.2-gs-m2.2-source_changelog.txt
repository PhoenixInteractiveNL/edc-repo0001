What's new in Gens for Linux v2.15.2/GS-m2.2?

Milestone 2.2 fixes the following bugs:

- Fixed several bugs with savestate support, including matching struct alignment
  with Gens/Rerecording (Win32) and incorrectly reading x86 memory pointers
  for the emulated Z80 CPU. Please note that savestates from previous versions
  of Gens/GS will not work correctly on m2.2; however, you can load the
  savestates in another emulator, such as the original Gens, and resave it in
  the older format. The older format savestate will then work on Gens/GS.

- CD-ROM drive support is now conditional via the ./configure script.

- 32-bit color now works for 32X games.
