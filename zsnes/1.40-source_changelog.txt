v1.40 - December 25, 2004
............................................................

All Ports:
----------
  - Added multiple timing tweaks, fixed various emulation bugs, and many other
    technical updates, including (but not limited to): SPC core updates (with
    improved sound decoding), safer memory allocation in certain areas, HIRQ and
    VIRQ fixes, color add/sub and color bleeding fixes, HDMA improvements,
    sprite priority and flickering fixes, and a slew of SRAM fixes. Many more
    games work :D. [pagefault, _Demo_, Nach, TRAC, Overload, theoddone33]
  - Overhauled a lot of code, such as checksum calculation and mirroring code.
    Overhauled and added much better EHi/Hi/Lo ROM code, improved reset vector,
    and changed much hard coding to variables. Fixed more SRAM bugs than we can
    count. Made optimizations to complex loading functions, syntax, memory init
    (Thanks kode54), execution, and initialization code. Also greatly improved
    PAL/NTSC detection. Also now has much better chip detection and gives more
    informative chip names. More games which never loaded before now load
    properly, such as Dai Kaiju Monogatari 2; it now loads and plays great
    without the Dejap patch. [Nach]
  - Cleaned up, overhauled, removed, and ported a lot of code (asm to C).
    [pagefault, MKendora, Nach]
  - Overhauled IO latch behavior, added proper latching behavior and other latch
    fixes (such as proper latching of bit 7 on $4201), and added proper behavior
    of RDIO regs. [pagefault]
  - Removed many, many hacks. [Nach, pagefault]
  - There have been some modifications and reorganizations of the GUI, including
    new path setup and chip configuration windows and a reorganization of the
    Game Key window. [pagefault, Nach]
  - Updates to the video code, with enhancements of triple buffering, better
    input support in the video dialog, and other general video code updates and
    bug fixes, such as a fix for the 60hz mode. [pagefault, MaxSt]
  - New extra options are now available in various locations, like the "GUI
    burning effect", new commandline options, a new quick key to control players
    1/2 with 3/4, and smaller message text. Some obsolete ones have been
    removed. [pagefault]
  - Some changes in the Input configuaration: Hitting "Set Keys" is now
    prevented if controller is set to "None". Also, if no controller is
    selected, the settings of the individual keys are now locked. [Nach]
  - Updated default configuration, in general. For example, stereo sound is now
    enabled by default at 32khz, with gaussian interpolation. [pagefault]

    compiler fixes and code cleanups. [Nach, MKendora, theoddone33, pagefault,
