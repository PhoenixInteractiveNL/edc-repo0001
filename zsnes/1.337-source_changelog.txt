zsKnight Leaves - July 23, 2001
............................................................

I'm sorry to say this, but this marks my permanent leave from the ZSNES project,
anything related to this, and emulation overall. The reason why is that my dad
just passed away today (he died in his sleep, which is strange since he was
perfectly healthy yesterday night), so I'm going to have to spend more of my
energy devoted to helping my family. My dad is also the main person who provides
the finances to the family (since my mom doesn't work), plus I still have about
2 more years to go before I graduate from university, so my immediate future
doesn't look that great because with my dad gone, that would mean that I need to
put up more responsibility towards taking care of the family instead of
studying. But I just hope that everything will go well. Thanks to all you
supporters for everything. Sorry for the lack of a proper goodbye though, so
I'll probably update once more after I get out of this shock in another day.
