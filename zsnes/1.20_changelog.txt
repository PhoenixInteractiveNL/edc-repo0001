v1.20b, Win v0.88
      - Final Fantasy Mystic Quest works again.
      - Fixed Empire Strikes Back crashing bug in the millenium falcon
        sequence (hopefully this will fix some other games too)
      - Removed all self-modifying code in ZSNES.  This will make ZSNES crash
        a lot less on certain systems, especially during mode 7 sequences.
        Thanks Ivar!
      - Implemented S-RTC chip, using the system clock as the actual
        time (The game will make you set the time though, but it will just
        be replaced with the system time in-game).  Thanks to John Weidman and
        Dark Force for the info on this chip!
      - Fixed crashing bug in certain mosaic scenes (eg. FF3 Phantom Forest)
        in the new graphics engine
      - Fixed a nasty crashing/corruption bug in the new graphics engine
        (both 8bit and 16bit)
      - SPC7110 emulation!  This is based on the information reverse
        engineered by the hard working folks at dejap translations,
        Dark Force and John Weidman.
      - Altered HiROM/LoROM detection a bit - Fievel goes West works now
      - Open source preparations [teuf]
      - In-game clock working for the windows port.  [kode54]
      - Fixed a memory leak problem in the new graphics engine [TRAC]
      - Added Cubic Spline Interpolation [Anti Resonance]
      - Fixed a assign/compare size bug in the new graphics engine [TRAC]
      - Fixed b flag setting in BRK instruction in 6502 emulation mode
        [zsKnight]
      - Added SPC7110 logger file output to help in the filesize clipping of
        the SPC7110 data files [zsKnight]
      - Fixed a memory leak bug, fixing that nasty Win2K crash bug
        [Matthew Kendora]
      - Fixed key combination release [Maxim]
      - Fixed source code warnings/added necessary includes [Maxim]
      - Added high priority mode for Windows 2000 users and slower
        computers (works on Windows 9x as well) [pagefault]
      - Added large sound buffer option for people having DirectSound
        problems. [pagefault]
      - Fixed problem with ZSNESW and Opera causing a BSOD. [pagefault]
      - Fixed up error reporting for people experiencing problems. [pagefault]
      - Improved performance on 3dfx cards by compiling with DirectX 8
        SDK. [pagefault]
      - Fixed a sound problem with people with messed up config files.
        [pagefault]
      - Fixed FF3 flashing line problem [zsKnight]
      - Fixed mysterious sprite disappearing bug in the new graphics engine
        [zsKnight]
      - Reduced noise in ToP opening theme.  It works fine in the DOS port,
        but the windows port still seems to produce some static, probably
        because of the way how sound is updated in that port. [zsKnight]
      - Updated Super 2xSaI and Super Eagle code (should be much faster
        now on MMX processors) [Kreed, added by pagefault]
      - Added gzip support [teuf]
      - Added support for ViBRA16 cards [Peter Santing]
      - No longer requires zlib.dll file, now statically linked. ZSNESw won't
        crash anymore if you try to load a .zip file without that dll file.
        [pagefault]
      - Now compiled using an optimising compiler [pagefault]
      - Almost a fully re-written DSP-1 emulation engine!
        [zsKnight, theoddone33, pagefault, teuf].  Also thanks to CrASH_Man
        for the 3x3 inverse matrix formula.
      - Fixed memory leak problem in the windows port during exit [pagefault]
      - And more ...
