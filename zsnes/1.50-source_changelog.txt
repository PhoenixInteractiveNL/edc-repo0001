v1.50 - December 22, 2006
............................................................

All Ports:
----------
For this release, we spent much time rewriting, porting, and improving many
internal subsystems. ZSNES is a program with over 200,000 lines of source code,
and in this release, over 25% of that has been modified; also, around 15% of the
assembly has been ported to C. The upcoming list, while large, can't fully
describe the amount of work done and the amount of improvements made. Be sure to
see the readme to find out how to use all the new features.

  Subsystem Additions/Updates/Rewrites/Fixes/Improvements
  ----------
  - Ryan C. Gordon's ManyMouse support added. [Nach, pagefault]
    This allows the systems compatible with ManyMouse (Windows XP, Linux via
    evdev if read permission set, Mac OS X) to handle each mouse plugged into
    the system separately. So now games with two mouse-using devices can be
    played with 2 players (or 1 player controlling both) on a single PC.
    Left Handed Mouse Support. [Nach, Deathlike, Jonas Quinn]
    So lefties can have the buttons for a particular mouse swapped if they so
    desire.
  - Rewrote directory handling system. [Nach, Jonas Quinn, grinvader, Deathlike]
    The old system, dubbed "ZFile", only kept track of files in a limited manner
    allowing for many many bugs. The new system, dubbed "ZPath", now tracks
    files and paths in a clean systematic manner to eliminate all file/path
    related bugs that have made previous versions annoying. All file handling
    code is now done in C and has many functions to make it easier for anyone
    else to jump right into this bit of development. This also allows for many
    new features to be written, and we wrote quite a few. A debug system has
    also been added, making it easy to track file issues regardless of the
    operation system in question.
  - ZMV Rewritten - Movie Support. [Nach, grinvader, ipher]
    Added support for subtitles while playing a ZMV. [Nach]
    Can now load movies via command line parameter. [Nach]
    Added parameter to close ZSNES when movie is closed. [Nach]
    Our movie subsystem - ZMV has been completely rewritten from the ground up.
    Now features such as rerecording (via states and rewind), appending, mouse
    recording, Super Scope recording (buggy), chapters, start types, frame
    count, input compression, among other things are now all supported. Note
    ZSNES can still load old ZMVs; however, it should be noted that ZMVs are
    somewhat version reliant and may desync on a version it was not recorded
    with. Also, most of the new features will not work when using an old ZMV.
  - Can now dump ZMVs to AVI and WAV. [Nach, Bisqwit]
    For years, users have requested being able to convert a ZMV to something
    else; it is now possible.
  - Added IPS multipatch support. Goes from IPS, IP0, IP1, IP2, ..., IP9. [Nach]
    So you can have IPS autopatching apply more than one to a game loaded.
    IPS files now loaded from save directory then ROM directory. [Nach]
    Making it easier for a user to auto patch.
    Fixed silly mistake with size adjustment of IPS patches. [Nach]
    So now the very rare broken IPS should work.
  - Rewind and ZST code fully merged; rewind should now work where save states
    do (Fixes rewinding in Super Bomberman games). [grinvader, Nach]
    Can now use 100 save states instead of 10. [Deathlike, Nach, Jonas Quinn]
    SRAM is now stored in save states and can be optionally loaded from them.
    [grinvader, Nach]
    Can now select how many rewind states you want. [grinvader, Nach, ipher]
    Can now select how much time is in between rewinds. [grinvader, Nach, ipher]
    Our state saving subsystem has been completely rewritten (although another
    rewrite is planned) to fix many bugs that used to be present. With the ZST
    and rewind code merged, it also means no more issues where one works but not
    the other. This is also now all done in C, making it easier to deal with, as
    well as allowing many new features as listed above.
  - Parsegen invented (thanks grinvader, gladius). [Nach]
    Binary and text config files merged into one and heavily updated. [Nach,
    grinvader, Deathlike]
    We invented a new programming language (PSR), and a compiler for it
    (parsegen), which allows one to keep track of variables in a simple manner
    for both developers and end users. Developers can just declare a particular
    variable to be tracked and forget about it, letting the system manage
    everything else, making it easy to add as many configuration options as one
    likes. For the end user, the config file is all in text, making it easy to
    modify any feature they like or features for advanced users not changeable
    from within the GUI. It also provides a level of future compatibility so
    users should normally not have to delete config files between versions. It
    also allows partial config files, so users can delete certain settings and
    have them restored to their defaults. All this is possible while maintaining
    a high level of flexibility.
  - Netplay, Modem, IPX code removed. [grinvader, Nach. ipher]
    As much as we hated to do this, we had to remove all computer-to-computer
    playing options in order to fix up the other subsystems since the code was
    spread throughout ZSNES. We hope to reimplement it in future versions and
    also provide new features.
  - Created new macros and greatly eased GUI development and cut down on size of
    GUI code. [ipher]
    Cleaned up GUI and reorganized it. [ipher, Nach, grinvader, Deathlike,
    Jonas Quinn]
    Added tab support to the GUI and made good use of it. [grinvader]
    Rewrote the load game menu, it can now handle thousands upon thousands of
    ROMs at a time. [Nach, grinvader]
    Added a custom font system. [ipher, Deathlike]
    Nach input boxes (video, path) now have a normal blink rate. [Nach]
    Now using our custom GUI should be easier and more straight forward. Almost
    everywhere you look, you should see a cleaner design, new features, and
    fewer bugs. See below for more specifics.
  - New unified ZSNES loader which is also less buggy. [Nach, grinvader,
    Deathlike, Jonas Quinn]
    Now command line options are handled in a more efficient manner, as well as
    making it much easier for us to add more.
  - Committed the ZSNES development toolkit. [Nach, grinvader]
    Code is now always in executable sections, fixes NX and many other issues.
    [Nach]
    Added utility to auto detect best -march option to compile with; SDL port
    uses it automatically. [Nach, grinvader]
    For various developers, we now added many utilities to make working on ZSNES
    much easier. Some of these utilities should be built into the assembler but
    aren't. These new utilities have also allowed us to easily track down
    several critical bugs and fix them effortlessly. We also have a utility now
    to aid the person compiling to get the best optimization out of their build,
    perhaps now allowing them to use HQ4x or other filters that weren't possible
    before.
  - Updated build setups. [grinvader, Nach]
    Added file dependency utility. [Nach]
    All the build setups have been updated to make it easier and more flexible
    for one to compile ZSNES and encounter fewer bugs along the way. File
    dependencies can now also be calculated automatically (most notably for
    SDL), so one updating ZSNES doesn't run into weird issues with only half of
    a fix being compiled.
  - Ported much assembly to C.
    [grinvader, Deathlike, Nach, Jonas Quinn, theoddone33, pagefault, byuu]
    Removed dead code. [grinvader, Nach, pagefault, Jonas Quinn, Deathlike]
    Lastly on our big rewrite, a lot of old junk went, and many complex and
    annoying features are now in C, meaning that if you know C, now is a good
    time to start helping out ZSNES development.

  Special Chips

  - Behold true ROM mirroring. If your translation breaks now, fix it. [Nach,
    grinvader]

    all the emulators that use hacks). [pagefault, grinvader, Nach, Jonas Quinn]
  - Fixed small screen extra line issues (fixes Super Metroid annoying
    line issue, so now that guy who keeps on coming into the channel
    annoying us about it can rest in peace). [pagefault, Nach]
