        re-write the timing engine later (but not anytime soon though)
        [zsKnight]
      - Kinda got Rendering Ranger 2 to go further, but this game seems to
        use some picky timing, so this will have to wait until I re-write
        timing in the future. [zsKnight]
      - Removed large sound buffer option since it wasn't really useful
        [pagefault]
      - Fixed 16bit access to address $001FFF (or equivalent).  Fixes Super
        Tetris 2+Bombliss. [zsKnight]

        suffers graphics glitches at the moment) [zsKnight]

        [zsKnight]
      - Combined the new header detection method with the old one, producing a
        much better method [zsKnight]

        [zsKnight]
      - Fixed "freeze data" text [hpsolo]
      - Fixed SA-1 write to BWRAM bitmap mode.  It seems like this was the
        main cause of the level-up screen not working in Mario RPG. [zsKnight]
      - Fixed cpu usage when ZSNES is in the background doing nothing
        [pagefault]
