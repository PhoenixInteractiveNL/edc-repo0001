v1.35 - June 23, 2002
............................................................

  - Fixed triple buffering corruption on some VESA 2.x video modes, a very nasty
    bug which accidentally slipped into version 1.337. [stainless] (DOS only)
  - Added full scanlines to 320x256x8b Mode-X.  Uses the same timings
    as the 256x256x8b full scanlines, so it may or may not work
    correctly depending on your video card. [stainless] (DOS only)
  - Linked the EAGLE engine to the filtered GUI option and fixed
    guassian interpolation which has been broken since version 1.71b.
    [stainless, kode54] (DOS only/all ports)
  - Cleaned up the 320x480x8b and 320x240x16b blitters and added
    MMX support to 320x480x8b for a nice speed increase. [stainless] (DOS only)
  - Added 640x400 alternatives to 512x384 video modes for video cards which
    don't have them.  Added a small screen option to the 512x384 and 640x400
    video modes with MMX support.  Also added a "wide screen" option to
    640x400 video modes. [stainless] (DOS only)
  - Added a full screen option to the 320x480 video modes, along
    with a basic interpolation to 320x240x16b and 320x480x16b
    Full screen in 320x480x16b has full/25%/50% scanlines and
    interpolation has full scanlines. [stainless] (DOS only)
  - Added experimental 800x600 video modes.  Fixed 'n' command-line
    option to allow toggling of 25%/50% in addition to full, also
    cleaned up the command-line options message and the config file.
    Noticed some video modes were way off-centered, fixed that
    too, should now be perfect. [stainless] (DOS only)
  - Fixed printing of MMX enabled message on the GUI background if you checked
    MMX SUPPORT under CONFIG -> OPTIONS.  Also, if you check MMX SUPPORT by
    using the keyboard shortcut it will now attempt to actually detect MMX
    before enabling it. :) [stainless, pagefault] (DOS only)
  - Command line support in windows port [StatMat]
  - Fixed problem when some video modes were not being saved. (Windows only)

    option (fixes a few cards under WinMe), a second water effect, and
    an experimental smoke effect. [stainless] (DOS only/all ports)
  - Fixed problem with sound getting disabled when running command-line
    network games. (Windows only) [pagefault]
  - Updated video code in Windows port to properly display 239 line modes.
    (Windows only) [pagefault]
  - Commented, unified, and cleaned up the Mode-Q and Mode-X blitters.  I did a
    major overhaul to the DOS video code, I cleaned up and reorganized it alot,
    and there seem to be no problems as of yet. [stainless, TRAC] (DOS only)
  - Fixed a bug in sprite priority rotation. (fix damage in FFMQ) [TRAC]

    on map in Front Mission. [pagefault]
