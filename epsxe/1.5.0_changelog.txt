ePSXe v1.5.0, released on xx.01.2002

- Fixed a bug in MDECs, which caused Metal Gear Solid and Rayman 1 to 
  crash. Furthermore, the MDEC options aren't read from the windows 
  registry any more, so you can only disable them with command lines 
  from now on.

- Rewritten the code what loaded the ps-exe files when starting a game, for 
  a better detection of the games name and the region.

- Added native support for ppf files. Now you don't need to patch the games 
  any more, simply copy your ppf file into the directory "/patches", with 
  the same name than the main PS-exe file in the cdrom (SLES*,SCES*,
  SLUS* ...), in uppercase. ePSXe will load it on startup then and patch 
  the game in memory on the fly !

- MCI code is now disabled in WinNT/2k/XP, expect when you are using an 
  external CD-ROM plugin which has its own CDDA functions (e.g. Pete's). 
  Furthermore, the external CD-ROM plugins can now play some games like 
  Tomb Raider I and II PAL, what was not possible before due to a bug 
  in 1.4.0.

- Fixed a bug in the internal CD-ROM plugins, which caused some games to 
  hang when they played CDDA sound and later accessed a data 
  sector (Rayman 1)

- Fixed some bugs in savestates. New savestate are not compatibles with old 
  epsxe versions, but the savestates from a savestate from an old version 
  can still be loaded. The command line -ssv0 has been added, which 
  will let ePSXe save the savestates into the old (but buggy) format. 
  (Fixed savestates in square mdecs, and in threads of fate)

- Some games which ran only with a certain bios version, should now run 
  with any (only checked with Legend of Dragon PAL)

- Fixed some GTE bugs. (Looney Tunes: Perro y Lobo, Nhl 99)

- Included a file with help, what can be accessed from help->contents.
  (Thanks to Bobbi)

- Last hour changes in internal spu, what fixes Metal gear solid and
  Valkyrie profile sound, but we have not had too time for test it ;)

- Added a new workaround in order to run Parasite Eve 2 (thanks to 
  Psychojak!). You need to use the command "-pe2". Some PE2 versions are 
  automaticly detected and don't need it though. We didn't play through 
  the complete game though, we can't tell if it's playable until the end.

- Fixes to the CD-Rom decoder and the core, which make some more games 
  playable like for example Valkyrie profile, Syphon filter series speech, 
  Rayman 1, Micromachines V3, Croc 2, Duke Nukem: Land of Babes, Vrally 2 
  and Nfs 5 menus, Time Crisis 2 music, Casper Around the World ...

- Multiples games can be played using additional commands like: 
  Rebelt Assault 2 (-noignorecmd), Micromaniacs (-cdtiming), 
  Front Mission 3 (-nocdinc) ...
