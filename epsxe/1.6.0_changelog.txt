  Omega Boost JAP, Wild Arms 2nd Ignition JAP, Saga Frontier 2 JAP,
  Chocobo Racing JAP and possibly others.

- Added support for autopause when playing CDDA sound. It should fix the
  problems with music in games like Tomb Raider I.

- Added support for report mode when playing CDDA sound. It fixes 
  tekken 1 music and Lemmings 3D. (if you have problems with this change
  it can be disabled with the commandline -disablereportmode).

- Fixed some problems reading subchannel. (Harvest Moon)

- Minnor changes to change disc function. (Arc the lad 3)

- Now the memcards are autosaved on the fly. It should solve the
  problem of lost your memcards if the emulator crashes on gameplay.

- Added gun emulation using a mouse. (Time Crisis 1, 2)

- Now the mouse emulacion can be selected in the second gameport, anyway
  only 1 mouse is supported yet, so if you do enable it, it will be
  disabled in the first pad.

- It is possible now select analog, digital and disabled mode in every gamepad. 
  (Thanks to everybody who helped testing it :)

- Included multitap support. In this version only 1 multitap is 
  supported. If you select multitap, it will support 4 gamepads, what
  will be connected to the first gameport of the psx. Multitap only
  must be enabled in games what supports it, in the rest of the games
  will not work the gamepads if multitap is enabled.

- The keys F5 and F6 have in the new version a different function. F6 is
  used for select a pad, and F5 will toggles digital/analog mode in the 
  pad selected. (you need upgrade your gpu plugins to 1.73 or superior)

- The dos window what shows the info messages, can be enabled/disabled from GUI.
