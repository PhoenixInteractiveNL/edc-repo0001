ePSXe v1.0.1, released on xx.xx.2000

- A completly re-written MDEC engine, which should give you better quality
  and some more FPS during video playback.
- More accurate timing, what means that videos should pause less. (MDEC
  timing should always be turned ON now)
- Included two new internal CD-Rom plugins : One for WinNT/Win2k users,
  which uses WinNT/Win2k's native functions, and an ASPI CD-Rom plugin
  for Win9x and Win2k users, which is usually faster than the older plugins.
- Fixes to XA sound playback in the internal SPU plugin.
- Included NTSC/PAL auto detection for a more accurate timing, mainly
  in Square videos.
- The ISOs are loaded directly now, without showing the BIOS logo. 
- Added support for PSX mouse emulation. (Selectable in Config -> Controller)(*)
- Added support for PSX analog pad emulation using Analog Pads or mouse.
  (selectable in Config- > Controller)(*)
- It's now possible to disable the pads; this is necessary for some games which
  are only playable for 1 player. (qbert)
- Included a new memory card selector, which comes with support for the most
  important memory card formats (.MCR, .MEM, .MCD, .GME)
- Memory cards are saved now when you go to the main window and when you exit
  the emu incorrectly. It's still highly recommended though to close down the
  emu using the File -> Exit option ;-)
- Added an experimental "Change discs" option. To switch a disc, you need to
  go to File -> Change disc. (this isn't working with some games yet though)
- ePSXe should work better with Lewpy's plugins now, so no more crashes when
  you exit the emu. The reset/continue functions should also work now on several
  videoboards.
- Fixes to the CD-Rom decoder and the core, which make some more games playable
  like for example Final Fantasy 9, Grandia, Fear Effect, Tenchu 2 and so on ;-)
- Added a snapshot maker in key F8. (you need the "snap" directory).
- Since we haven't been able to fix the Chrono Cross bug yet, we added a workaround,
  which can be activated using the F3 key while the game freezes at that point 
  (though this doesn't fix the status screen problem yet, you must still use the
  cheat code for this)
