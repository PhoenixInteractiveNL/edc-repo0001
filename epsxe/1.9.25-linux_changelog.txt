ePSXe v1.9.25, released on 27.01.2015

- Added HLE bios support (an official PS1 is recommend yet). From this
  version ePSXe can run ps1 games without an official PS1 bios, it includes
  HLE bios emulation. Support is limited, but it is good enought to run a
  very high number of games.
  VERY IMPORTANT: Savestates done with a official PS1 bios are NOT compatible 
  with savestates done with ePSXe HLE bios (Besides it uses a different namespace).

- Fixed multi-bin format in Windows version (redump format). Now it supports
  the games saved in multiple bins files + cue file directly.

- Better SBI subchannel support (for example in Medievil) and fixed SBI in games 
  with ECM format. Added SBI support in MDS/MDF format.

- Added support to save memcards by game. Enabling this option it will
  create 2 memcards by everygame in memcards/games/ folder, using the serial
  of the game. In multidisc games, it will share the same memcards by all
  of discs.

  playable or working better like. For example this fixed
