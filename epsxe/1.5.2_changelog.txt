ePSXe v1.5.2, released on xx.05.2002

- Fixed a bug which got into 1.5.2 regarding several gte flags 
  (Porsche Challenge, Tomb Raider).

- Partially rewrote the CD-Rom decoder, now it doesn't need custom flags 
  in order to run various games any more.

- Moved the subchannel read options to it's own window in the CD-Rom 
  configuration. Also added a new subchannel reading mode, which works 
  with various LG 852x cdrom drives.

- Fixed a bug in the internal SPU plugin, which has been there since v1.5.0! 
  It caused sound effects to repeat and several games to freeze 
  (BOF series, Soul Blade).

- Added support for the Nero ISO format (.nrg).

- Massive changes to the SIO emulation. It should have better timing now and 
  the F4 trick shouldn't be necessary that often any more. "SIO irq always on" 
  has been removed from the GUI, but you can still turn it on using the F4 
  key. (affects Silent Hill esp, Track & Field, Metalslugx, NFS5 PAL, Rapshody ...)

- Fixed a bug in the internal ISO reading routines, which prevented some of the 
  last sectors to be accessed.

- As the Chrono Cross trick isn't necessary any more, we have assigned a new 
  trick to the F7 key, for the Xenogears dreams sequence: Press this key at 
  the beginning of the scene, and once again after the end ;)

- Fixes to the CD-Rom decoder and the core, which made some more games 
  playable like, for example, Theards of Fate, NBA Basketball 2000, 
  Legend of Mana, Rebelt Assault 2, Tekken 2, MegamanX series, 
  Jackie Chan US, Michelin Rally Masters, Transformers Beast of Wars ...
