ePSXe v2.0, released on 02.17.2016

- First of all, ePSXe 2.0 now requires Windows Vista or superior. While 
  it could work on Windows XP SP3, it has not been tested.

- Multi-language support. This is the first ePSXe release officially supporting
  multiple languages. Currently there is support for English, Spanish, Japanese
  (thanks to Nekokabu) and Italian (thanks to Domus). If you want to help us
  translate the emulator to other language let us know at epsxepc@gmail.com.

- Added a gamelist window. Now you can open a gamelist window by selecting
  File->Open Gamelist or clicking on the letters "PSX" from the ePSXe logo.
  From this window you can select the folders to scan and click on refresh to
  create a gamelist with the games found in the those folders. Additionally you
  can get the mini-icon covers for the games in the gamelist. There is also
  support for multi-PBP files and ECM files.

- Improved CPU accuracy. Dynarec and the interpreter accuracy has been improved
  fixing some possible corner cases. The main goal of the dynarec is performance,
  so it is less accurate than the interpreter mode.

- Adjusted overall timing. The FPS and Mhz have been adjusted to match the real
  PSX on NTSC and PAL. It helps synchronization in some games such as Bust a
  Groove 1 & 2 during songs (those games requires low sound latency).

- Improved GTE support. The GTE accuracy has been improved to match the
  Android version. In addition this version support 2 hacks for the GTE.
  Widescreen support which is used to stretch the screen to 16:9 without
  modifying the aspect of 3D objects. Given it is a hack it will fail in some
  games, especially those combining 2D and 3D.
  Subpixel precision (gte accuracy hack thanks to Edbla) which allows more
  precision to be kept through computations but requires a gpu renderer
  supporting this feature.

- Ported the Soft GPU from the Android version. The new GPU Core requires
  a videocard supporting OpenGL2 + GLSL shader. It is a very accurate soft GPU,
  supporting features such as:
    - Increased internal resolution at x2 and x4. (very fast CPU required for x4)
    - Brightness profiles, to increase the brightness in dark games.
    - Stretching modes: 4:3, stretching or widescreen
    - 2D filters: 2xSai, xBRZ (thanks to Zenju)
    - Shaders: FXAA/CRT-Lottes (thanks to Lottes), CRT-Hyllian/xBR-LV2-3D (thanks
      to Hyllian)
    - Simple custom Shaders (a pack with examples is available on epsxe.com/files)
    - Scanlines suport
    - Removing of top/bottom black bands in some games.
    - Sub-pixel precision (or gte accuracy hack).
  (Special thanks to Pete Bernert :)

- Included the Pete Opengl2 GPU core. It is the Pete OGL2 gpu core included in
  the ePSXe Core. This version is the actual Pete OGL2 plugin supporting a 
  sub-pixel precision (or gte accuracy hack), memory detection and fix the game
  Guardian Recall. Millions of thanks to Pete Bernert, Tapcio and Edbla. 

- Teamviewer incompatibility is resolved with the internal GPU plugins. The GPU
  Core and Pete Opengl2 GPU core are not affected by the incompatibility with
  the TeamViewer software.

- Added a configuration window to select options for the internal SPU Plugin.
  Currently it is possible to select the sound latency (normal or very low -
  required on Bust a Groove 1 & 2) and enable/disable some sound effects
  (filters and reverb).

- Fixed support for CDDA music in external SPU plugins.

- Improved the internal input plugin. Improved multitap to support a lot of games
  that did not work in the previous versions. Added support to autofire. Now you
  can select up to 4 buttons for player-1 and player-2 as autofire, and
  configure the repeat frequency by button.

- Added support for Konami Justifier gun using the mouse for games such as Die
  hard Trilogy, Area 51, Lethal Enforcers, Crypt Killer, Project - Horned Owl,
  Lethal enforces I & II.

- External Input plugins support. This version supports external input plugins
  such as Pokopom. You can select a plugin for the Port 1 and Port 2, but it is
  recommended that if you want use both an external plugin and the internal
  plugin you select the external plugin in the first port. Thanks to Shalma.

- Added game profile by game. In this version it is possible during the gameplay
  to save your preferences for the current game. The next time that you run the
  same game it will use those preferences. All internal settings in every
  plugin included with the emulator are supported (spucore, gpucore and Pete
  Opengl2 GPU Core).

- Improved auto-PPF support. Now the PPFv3 version is supported, and it is
  possible to auto-load up to 8 PPFs per game. The filenames used must be
  "(PS-EXE-ID)-00", "(PS-EXE-ID)-01". Ex: SLPS_013.00-00, SLPS_013.00-01.

- Improved cheat support. Fixed cheatcodes gameshark conditional, added
  increment/decrement types (0x10-11, 0x20-21) and copy type (0xc2).

- Improved HLE bios emulation. Starting with version 1.9.25, the HLE bios has
  been improved to support more games: Wild Arms, Jet Moto, Toca World Touring,
  Simcity 2000. Memcards support was improved for a lot of games such as
  Dinocrisis 2, Metal Gear Solid, V-Rally2, Diablo, Ridge Racer Type 4, Driver,
  Echo Night and Azure Dreamns.

- Fixes to the CD-ROM decoder and the core which made around to 40 more games
  playable or better working.
