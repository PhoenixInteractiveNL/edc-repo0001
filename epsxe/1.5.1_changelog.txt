ePSXe v1.5.1, released on xx.03.2002

- Included partial support for libcrypt games. Libcrypt is a protection
  scheme used very often in PAL games. It uses data in subchannel Q.
  In order to play your original cd games in ePSXe you need a cdrom reader
  which works with the read-subchannel routines in ePSXe. NOT every cdrom
  reader with support for read subchannels will work in epsxe. If your cdrom
  reader is able to read subchannels but it is not supported by ePSXe,
  you can use clonecd to read the subchannel to a .SUB file, and copy it
  in the epsxe\patches directory with the same name than cdrom PS-EXE
  and with the extension .SUB (SLESXXX.XX.SUB/SCESXXX.XX.SUB/SLUSXXX.XX.SUB..)
  Since reading from subchannel is slow, ePSXe includes an option in the
  cdrom config window that you can enable to cache the subchannel to disk
  the first time you run a game. Of course you can always use some external
  cdrom plugins, currently only Pete's cdrom plugin supports it.
  (The support is partial because NO every libcrypt game is working :(,
  the no working games includes (at least) Spyro 2 and 3 PAL, and
  formula one 99) 
 
  In resumen:

  1) If you want subchannel support only from files, select in the cdrom config 
     window "Enable subchannel support".

  2) If you want subchannel support from cdrom, select in the cdrom config window
     "Enable subchannel support" and 
     "Enable subchannel read from cdrom."
     If your cdrom is able to read subchannels in epsxe, a message will be
     shown in the console between the rest of init messages.

  3) If you want to caching to disk the subchannel the first time what you
     run a game, select in the cdrom config window:
     "Enable subchannel support", 
     "Enable subchannel read from cdrom." and
     "Enable subchannel caching to disk."

  4) If you have problems reading the cdroms after of select
     "Enable subchannel read from cdrom." probably your cdrom is not compatible
     with ePSXe subchannel read routines, disable this option, and make your
     own .sub files with CloneCD.

- Added support for Teac cdrom readers to internal cdrom plugins.
  (Thanks to Pete)

- Added support for pov hat joysticks.
  (Thanks to Roberto Paredes by multiples tests)

- Some CD stuff got fixed, like the problem with changing discs, the 
  internal win2k CD plugin CDDA problems and a bug with the ppf support of 
  the internal plugins.

- Fixes to the GTE, which solve problems with 102 Dalmatinas, Rugrats in
  paris, Destruction Derby 2, Nuclear Strike and possibly others.

- Changed some internal timing stuff, which should produce better (faster)
  background sound in several games (FF7, Threads of Fate, Valkyrie Profile)
  (You can use the old timing with -oldtiming)

- Removed the auto detection of game and required BIOS, as this prevented
  Legend of the dragoon US and Wild Arms 2 US from working.

- Removed the two options -cdinc and -nocdinc, as fixes made them 
  unncessary. In this version -noxaread has not some effect.

- Added support for MDEC transparency, for the Oddworld series, dw4/dw7 
  battle effects. 

- Added support for Capcom MDECs, but you need to use the command line
  -adjustiming, what will give serious problems with gamepad keys and
  memory cards (use F4 to fix this problems), and hard slowdowns.
  (Use this option in your own risk, we recommend to use it only when
  it will be really necessary).

- Included a new commandline, it is called -nocdoverwrite. It could fix
  problems with some games like Parappa the Rapper's demo. Sometimes
  it does the same than -cdtiming.

- LINUX version only: added partial support for external gamepad plugins.
  Actually only works the lamer0's plugin, what is combined with the
  internal pad plugin.

- Fixes to CPU and CD-Rom make games like Star Wars - The phantom Menace,
  Resident Evil 1 PAL, Legend of Legaia, Star Ocean 2, Gran Turismo JAP and
  Philisoma playable.
