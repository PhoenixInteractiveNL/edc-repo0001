ePSXe v1.2.0, released on 07.03.2001

- Added better analogic pad emulation and force feedback.
  It is now possible to configure the analogic axis and
  the effect of the force feedback motors. (Many thanks
  to Alex7 and to www.burutter.com, for donating a very nice
  psx to usb pad converter and giving help on adding support
  for it).

- Now ePSXe includes savestates support. F1 = save state,
  F2 = increase slot (max = 5), F3 = load state. The
  savestates are compressed and saved to the sstates directory,
  with an average size of 1.5Mb.
  (WARNING!!! In release date it is supported only in the
  following plugins: Lewpy Gpu, Pete Gpu, Pete Spu and ePSXe Spu,
  support will be included in more plugins soon
  by the plugins authors)

- Partially re-writen the internal spu, it should be
  faster, have less sound glitches and better sound quality.

- Optimizations added in gte, mdec and core which makes
  some games work some fps faster than before.

- Fixes to the CD-Rom decoder and the core, which make some more games
  playable like for example Gran Turismo, Resident Evil, Ape Escape,
  Kingley Adventure, Legend of Legaia (use the "-legaia" command line),
  Final Fantasy IX PAL and so on ;-)
