What's New in this version?
---------------------------

Atari++ 1.58


- Fixed emulation of read-modify-write instructions. The 6502 consistently
 writes the old value before replacing it by a second write with the
 updated value.

- The default alsa output device has been changed from hw:0.0 to default,
 making it more compatible to hardware setups.
	
- The disassembly of the BVC instruction was invalid, fixed.

- Added the space bar as possible source for joystick events.

- Fixed some issues with preferences reading.

- Added additional tests for ROM image verification.

- Fixed a NULL pointer reference in the cartridge module.
