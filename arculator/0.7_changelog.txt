Version 0.7 (09/05/06) :
Improved video code :
- Display centered always
- Multisync mode support (eg 640x480, 640x512 and 800x600)
- Borders always drawn correctly (eg Zelanites)
- Multisync modes are a useful workaround the desktop hanging bug!
Fixed bug with LDMxx!, !NewLook now works, Arthur desktop now works
Fixed bug in WD1772 FDC, disc writing now works again
Some improvements to ArculFS
