version 0.25 (22/07/05) :
Disc emulation improved - can now access 720k DOS disc images, write to discs, and up to 4
  drives now supported
Arculator will now try to load a 2 meg file called 'rom.rom' before trying ic24-ic27.rom. 
  This allows use of one-file ROM dumps, and Arthur, RiscOS 2 and ARM Linux ROM dumps (none
  of which really work, but never mind)
Slight changes to video emulation, Zelanites demo now looks okay
Slight ARM optimisations
