Version 0.8 (23/10/06) :
- Improved timing. Each model now performs much closer to the original machines (this means
   slower than previous versions).
- Can now emulate MEMC page sizes other than 32k, so all memory configurations from 512k to
   16 megs are now possible.
- Preliminary FDI support in 82c711 FDC.
- Better FDI support in WD1772 FDC, including FDI v2.1 support.
- Fast disc emulation in 82c711 FDC.
- Bugfixes to video code. Man United Europe now looks better. Less flicker in Populous, Zarch
  etc.
- Keyboard/mouse fix, now doesn't freeze in Lemmings 2 and some other games.
- Fixed broken sound in Sensible Soccer and Xenon 2.
- Sound now in stereo.
- Some minor optimisations.
- Seperate ROM + CMOS files for Arthur, RISC OS 2, RISC OS 3 (old FDC) and RISC OS 3 (new FDC).
- Added support for two MAME romsets that run on Archimedes hardware.
- Tracked WD1772 hanging bug down to an incorrectly set CMOS bit! Now fixed.
