version 0.5 (23/01/06) :
Working 82c711 emulation. This allows high density disc access and avoids the
 hanging bug in 1772 emulation.
Along with 82c711 emulation comes IDE hard disc emulation.
Preliminary FDI support (1772 only).
Increased frequency of keyboard/mouse updates - mouse now much smoother
Slight optimisations to video
