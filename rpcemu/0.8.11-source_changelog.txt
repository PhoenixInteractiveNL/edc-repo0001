Version 0.8.11 - 23/10/2013

Changes in this build

All Platforms
Support for emulating Phoebe, the Risc PC 2. Produced with the assistance of The Centre for Computing History.

Instructions on how to setup Phoebe emulation and the required files are on the 4corn website.

Note, this is a prototype machine, so is more for historical interest than running production code.

Introduced the concept of configuring the Hardware Model rather than using CPU type to determine hardware. See the Settings->Settings window for details. You may need to reselect a model based on your previous CPU choice.
Fix very rare bug in which the MIPS count was sometimes wildly incorrect.
Windows
Fix 'Follows Host Mouse' bug, where the host and emulated mouse pointers were not lined up until the RPCEmu window had been moved.
Fix network GUI bug where the selected networking type was not correctly set.
