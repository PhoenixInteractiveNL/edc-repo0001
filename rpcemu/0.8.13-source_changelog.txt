Version 0.8.13 - 21/10/2015

Changes in this build

All Platforms
Dynamic recompiler is no longer StrongARM specific. It supports a wider range of OSes with more processors. (RISC OS 3.50, 3.60, 3.70, 3.71, 5.22).
Host pointer integration (follows host mouse) now works in rectangular pixel modes (e.g. Mode 12).
The daylight saving time flag in CMOS should be automatically set on startup based on the timezone information from the host machine.
ARM Core
Abort handling of LDM/STM now follows the varying Abort Model of the different ARM processors.
LDM/STM now check for abort on each data transfer, which gives accurate abort detection.
Linux
The display now supports pixel doubling of rectangular pixel modes (e.g. Mode 12) in the same way as the Windows version.
