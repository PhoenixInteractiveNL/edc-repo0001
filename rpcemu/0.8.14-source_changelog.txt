Version 0.8.14 - 8/2/2016

Changes in this build

All Platforms
RISC OS Select 4i2 to 6i1 (6.06 to 6.20) now boot 'out of the box' due to clearing the *unplug bits in the distributed cmos.ram file. If applying the upgrade to an existing install you must use the provided cmos.ram file and then apply your changes to cmos settings afterwards.

If you have used the 'installer' version on windows Vista, 7, 8, 10 then you will probably need to delete the copy of cmos.ram that is in this directory
