What's New in this version?
---------------------------

Version 1.8 - 2nd November 2000 
New in this version are: CPC Plus support, more accurate video emulation, and various bugfixes and details. The XED editor and A22i assembler may be used as integrated development environment, ie. hitting F9 in the editor will automatically assemble the file, copy the resulting binary into a diskimage, and automatically start it in the emulator (for the DOS version this requires separately downloading XED from my webpage). 

* cpc plus: 4096 color palette, realizes/freshens palette changes
* cpc plus: ASIC memory, unlock sequence, relock sequence
* cpc plus: cartridge LOW and UPPER rom / EMS memory
* cpc plus: cartridges (CPR files) may include header+data or just clean data
* cpc plus: ROM image optimize patches (differences to 6128)
* cpc plus: ROM image rescue patch (kills ugly burnin' rubber menu)
* cpc plus: ROM image datazones (differences to 6128 and amsdos)
* cpc plus: hardware sprites, x- and y-magnification, parts offscreen, softswap
* cpc plus: sound DMA (no idea if it works), sound interrupts
* cpc plus: raster interrupts, soft scrolling, split facility
* cpc plus: CRTC Register 0Ch: 8th printer bit, and 32K vram bit?
* cpc plus: help: cpc plus hardware description
* cpc plus: no$gmb style color pool for up to 240 different colors on screen
* cpc plus: recognizes/ignores FDC command 0 (amsdos coldboot vs |cpm conflict)
* cpc plus: stack initialized at C000 instead 0000 (No Exit doesn't init SP)
* a22i/copy/edit: supports data exchange with MV/EXT dsks instead no$-dsks only
* a22i: xed/a22i interaction (lineno, autostart from editor, autoedit errors)
* a22i: fixed indirect 16bit ix/iy load commands like LD IX,(NNNN)
* a22i: copies assembled BIN files to BOOTDISK.DSK and autoloads/starts that
* a22i: autoloads and autostarts assembled cartridge CPR files
* a22i: assembler directive ".cpr" generates cpc plus cartridge (max 16Kbyte)
* video: supports multiple vertical-total areas per screen (netherworld)
* video: optional 360x240 oversize video mode, 256 color 640x200 and 720x240
* video: new video modes supporting VESA bios/driver and Tseng ET3000/ET4000
* video: scanline based display redraw mode (slow but more accurate)
* video: windows version invalidates/redraws screen border only if changed
* snapshots: new SNA format (v3) includes more details and supports cpc plus
* snapshots: uses SAVE-dialog (windows), fixed crash when hitting ESC (dos)
* file popup menu: added eject disk a/b functions
* setup: separate LK4 option (screen refresh), new LK7 option (bootsector)
* printer: defaults to new setting (none) - avoids windows NT lock ups
* rom: reduced 464/664/6128/PLUS system roms from 160K to 70K (cpc-pack.asm)
* rom: attached 464/664/6128/PLUS system roms as overlay to no$cpc.exe
* debugger: I/O Map shows state of BDIR/BC1
* debugger: I/O Map screen updated after run/trace in windows version also
* filemenu: allows more than 3 extensions/filetypes (DSK,ZIP,ARJ, and new CPR)
* about: aboutbox in dos version, icon: new amstrad icon (diagonal red line)
* emudetail: better offgrid interrupt emulation clears bit 5 (thanks ulrich)
* emudetail: gate array may manually acknowledge crtc interrupt (arnold5.rtf)
* emudetail: DAA instruction returns 100% correct AF for all 65536 incoming AF
* emudetail: enabled logic-command trueflags (undoc mask 28h) (shogun loader)
* emufix: enabled interseg_pipe/reljumps in windows & dos-rmode version (gryzor)
* emufix: unused keyboard rows (night shade, thanks cesario for bug report)
* emufix: fixed _@ADJUST_SP with SP=0000 in windows version (guild of thieves)
* emufix: major bug in _@mov_eintcount_ax macro didn't clear upper bits of eax
* emufix: refixed outi in 486 dos version (bh was set to zero before bl,[xbx])
* emufix: repaired fast write char in rmode dos version (symbol after 0, cp/m+)
* flat32: anal_sticks resets whole 8bit stick_present if absent (stuck 56rtttt)
* speedup: implemented no$msx boost-method (no delays during disk-io and reset)
* speedup: megaboost, switches to hispeed mode if more than 5 wrchr per frame
* speedup: uses spus/spop dummy macros instead push/pop ds/es in flat32 version
* calmdown: unlimted mhz disaster settings 100% and 50% frames working now
* internal: no$gmb shared init_path_sub,disksethomedir
* help: recognizes mouseclicks to place cursor/follow links (dos version)
* help: new chapter about repairing monitor (brightn/contrast/vhold regulators)
* help: added chapter about registering, exitmsg/aboutbox realizes reg-key file
* btw: programmed NO$CART (converts DSK-images to CPR-images, see webpage)
