Snapshot Release 0.4.4 13th June 2001

Changes in this version (didn't realise it was so long!)

RISC OS 4 works (at last). RISC OS 3.7 shouldn't have worked...
Some sound crackle is fixed. Some games and RiscPC will
still suffer from bad crackle or just noise.
Sound timing is handled in a different way which may improve
matters on Win2k but it may also have other unwanted effects
RiscPC memory/vram size is configurable.
HostFS configuration is less broken ;-)
Status bar indicators for floppy/ide work again
Very slow response on fast machines (>700mhz) is fixed. This
may rear its head again on > 1400Mhz machines.

Don't use 'Free' on large HostFS shares, it'll lock up the
desktop.
