This is version 0.6 of RedSquirrel.

Significant changes since version 0.6.x:

Computer suspend is handled more gracefully
Added StrongArm models - no faster, just for completeness
Significant speedups in HostFS
Fixed app name on message boxes
Software video scaling - much faster for low end graphics cards.
Fixed prefetch abort bugs
Sound pitch on Vidc1 should be correct
# key works on older models (mapped to numeric #)
Window deactivation clears key/mouse down events
Power cycle menu option, for when Hard Reset just isn't enough
'Roms' which are not 2^x in size now load correctly
Added printers command to hostfs to list printers
Fixed floppy image loading
Fixed Clock month offset by 1
added hostopen and hostprint commands
Fixed preferences not loading from RedSquirrel.cfg
HostFS selects first mount at startup
Added RTC centisecond timer
Totally reorganised code to support plugins
HostFS is now a completely separate plugin
RISC OS/Windows cursor syncing, provided by 3rd party plugin
	
Issues in this version:

There are some strange artefacts in software scaled modes. Model selection other
than at startup will almost certainly crash the application.
There is still no JIT support. This is for commercial versions only at present, sorry.
Timing is still not right in video code (most noticeable in Lemmings and Twinworld)
There still a SERIOUS bug in ide emulation. I suggest you move your files to a hostfs
mount as it is better in every way.
