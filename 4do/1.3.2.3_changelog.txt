A few basic improvements for the File Browser utility.

Changes:
Fixed file extraction – File extraction from the file browser was not functioning because of a missing DLL from the released 1.3.2.2 files.
File browser tweaks – Users can now cancel copy operations, and basic progress indicators have been added.
