Whats New ?
-----------

VERY quick one...

* Fixed silly YM2612 bug that I added in the last version.

* Now selecting -fullscreen from the command line will not alter fullscreen
  setting in the INI file.

That's pretty much it, the last version was unusable because of the silly
YM2612 bug, so I needed to get a new version out quickly. I had a look at
the MP3 problem some people were reporting, and made a small change to
fullscreen mode which *might* help. I'll need to rewrite my entire CDDA
handling code to make any real improvement, though... Some other time.

Snake.
