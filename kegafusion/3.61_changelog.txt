Whats New ?
-----------

Various fixes for problems found in the last version, plus a couple of
extras:

* Moved menus around a bit - the Country and CD Drive menus are now part
  of the Options menu. This fixes problems with the old menus not fitting
  properly in 320x240 mode, and is also a bit less cluttered.

* Timing was out by a small amount after I removed test code. It should
  now be back to where it was supposed to be, removing minor glitches from
  a few games.

* Problems with Vista-specific code reported by a few people should now
  be fixed. Please report any problems with this as soon as possible.

* Windowed VSync is not required, or desired, under Vista. Fusion now will
  default to ignoring the VSync flag when running windowed in Vista. There
  is an INI file option to re-enable it just incase this causes problems
  for anyone.

* Vista-specific code can also be disabled via another INI file option,
  incase this causes problems, or you're trying to run Fusion under Wine,
  Darwine, or Crossover.

* Sound effects in Primal Rage 32X are working again.

* AVI output now should not affect what you see on screen.

* Screenshot options - you can now select to save screenshots at various
  stages. Final is what you'd get from earlier versions, Corrected is non
  filtered but aspect corrected, and raw is not aspect corrected.

* Minor modifications to Render Plugin stuff.

* Upped the number of Render Plugins again, to 48. Please don't ask for
  any more, there isn't, and probably never will be, anything like 48
  different plugins that are actually worth bothering with ;)

* Modifications to Full Screen Resolution after noticing that default
  resolutions for large widescreen monitors were sometimes not appearing
  in the list. Should be fine now.

* A few more behind-the-scenes fixes.

Merry Christmas.
