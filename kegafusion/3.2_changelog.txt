Whats New ?
-----------

Again, another quick update:

* Fixed another YM2612 bug that I added in 3.11 - I accidentally deleted
  one line of code that I thought shouldn't be there while fixing the other
  bug from version 3.1. Doh.

* Rewrote another part of the YM2612 core. Should now be pretty much
  perfect.

* 32X PWM should now be the correct volume. I haven't noticed any nasty
  clipping yet, but if you do, just turn off overdrive.

* Slight change to SegaCD PCM. Don't know if this affects anything.

* Various internal changes that should hopefully make MP3 decoding work
  properly when VSync is on, or some slow render plugin is being used.

Now, this time, I really DO mean "Next update will come when I get my
life back." Hopefully this is only a month or so away. We shall see.
