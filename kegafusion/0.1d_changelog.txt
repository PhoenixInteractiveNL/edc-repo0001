Whats New ?
-----------

Yet Another Quick Update:

* Fixed Turrican (Genesis)

* Improved Command Line Support

* Forgot to add the 6 button changes to Alternate Timing mode. Is there now.

* Added GameGear Zoom Mode

* Added "Scanlines 0%" option and seperated them from the other options. Now you can
  select the type of Scanlines you want in any of the renderers

* Switched Power On and Soft Reset around, hopefully people will now only use the
  Soft Reset function when its actually useful ;-)

* Added "ForceFullScreen32" INI file setting


Command Line works as follows:

Fusion gamename.ext [console] [country] [-fullscreen]

Console options are: -sms, -gg, -gen or -md or -32x, -scd or -mcd
Country options are: -usa -jap -eur or -auto

Default console is Genesis/Megadrive.
Default country is whatever is set in the INI file, i.e. whatever was last used.

Apart from the filename, which must come first, all options can be in any order,
and are optional.

When using the -fullscreen option, the ESCAPE key will exit the emulator.


Snake.
