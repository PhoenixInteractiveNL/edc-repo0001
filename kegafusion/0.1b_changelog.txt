Whats New ?
-----------

ForceCompatibleGFX=1
CompatibleGFXOpt=0
EnhancedGFXOpt=1
DebugFlags=0,0,1,1

Quick update:

* Fixed the problem whereby you couldn't define the space bar as a key.

* Modified Graphics Code. Should now work by default on more systems.

* Moved the INI file settings to the top of the file for easier access.

* Added Render Plugin Support

The Graphics stuff and INI file editing:

There are now 4 different modes you can try - by default it uses a more
compatible, but possibly slower mode. If everything works fine you can
try setting EnhancedGFXOpt to 1 to see if that also works - this is usually
the fastest mode. If neither enhanced mode 0 or 1 work, you can set
ForceCompatibleGFX to 1, and then try CompatibleGFXOpt at 0 or 1 to see
which is the fastest. Also, on some older cards the enhanced mode may be
quite slow - if this is the case you should use Compatible mode.

I hope that this now works on a much wider range of graphics cards - let
me know :)
