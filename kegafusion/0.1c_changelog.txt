Whats New ?
-----------

Another Quick Update:

* Fixed Spiderman (32X)

* Fixed Joe and Mac (Genesis)

* Fixed Pirates Gold (Genesis)

* Fixed "Red Bar"

* Modified 6 Button Controller Code

* Added Command Line Support

* Another small modification to the Graphics code

* Added Message Box for first time run to try and cut down the number of
  people asking about the graphics settings...


Command Line works as follows:

Fusion gamename.ext [console] [-fullscreen]

Console options are: -sms, -gg, -gen or -md, -32x, -scd or -mcd

Default console is Genesis/Megadrive.

When using the -fullscreen option, the ESCAPE key will exit the emulator.


Thats all for now,

Snake.
