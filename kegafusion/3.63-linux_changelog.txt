Whats New ?
-----------

* Made some changes to the config options. Hopefully this fixes a problem
  some people were having where Windows would fail to size the window
  correctly, although I cannot reproduce this problem.

* Moved SMS controls into main controls window, matching the other builds.

* Fixed a couple of problems relating to SMS controls.

* Fixed preferred country detection order - at some point a couple of them
  got switched somehow.

* Various SMS fixes.

* A few minor 32X bugfixes and tweaks.

Other builds to follow soon.

Snake.
