Whats New ?
-----------

I'm making this unplanned release, because things never go as planned, and
all my stuff is going to be in storage for a while (again). Due to that
thing they call 'real life' I have probably forgotten most of what I've
changed since the last build, and there may be stuff I have only partially
implemented and forgotten about.

But I'll list what I remember, and I'm sure you guys (and girls) will find
stuff I forgot about, or broke - because you rock.

Most of what I've done is by user request. PLEASE LET ME KNOW OF ANY MAJOR
PROBLEMS IMMEDIATELY.

* Swapped SMS buttons

* Added an option (that I couldn't think of a suitable name for) to show
  the full SMS area when running GG games

* Fixed a couple of non-working SMS games (auto disable of some features,
  e.g. YM2413, which would cause them to crash if present)

* Fixed some other minor SMS issues

* GG games that are really SMS games in a GG cart should now auto boot in
  SMS mode

* A couple of 32X tweaks that will only matter to homebrew coders currently

* Fixed a couple of SegaCD games that didn't boot/run - if you find any
  more, please do let me know - as far as I know, there are none

* Command line with -scd or -mcd and no filename will now cause Fusion to
  start up in 'Boot SegaCD' mode

* Added support for the (pretty useless) SF7000 floppy disk interface for
  the SC3000 - you need the SF7000 IPL ROM for this to work

* SC3000 keyboard can now be enabled from the options menu

* A few sound tweaks

Regular scheduled programming will resume as soon as possible.
