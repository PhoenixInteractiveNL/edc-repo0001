Whats New ?
-----------

Not much, mainly just a few tweaks and minor bugfixes.

* Seperate SMS controls (finally) allowing for support of SMS Paddles and
  Light Phasers. The reason I haven't done this before is down to the UI.
  I don't much like the current solution, either, but it's functional for
  now.

* State Slots now report if they are already in use, by request.

* Allow changing state slots, and saving states (but not loading) during
  Netplay. I'm not sure what use this is, but it was often requested.

* Added support for a couple of Custom SRAM games that were recently
  discovered.

* Windows Live Messenger status updates. (thanks Gerrie!)

* Many small behind the scenes bugfixes that you probably won't notice, and
  I've mostly forgotten...

Fusion has not been my main focus since the last build, and this build (as
well as the other platform builds) have basically been sitting around since
January. However, one reason for this is that there were many changes made
that I've since reverted, because they were counter-productive. I wasn't
sure what to do with them - well, now they're gone until such a time as I
can do more hardware testing. This build (and other things...) have been
sitting around for way too long without further work or release.

Happy (almost) Halloween,
