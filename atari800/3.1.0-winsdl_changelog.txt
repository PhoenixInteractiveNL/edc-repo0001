** 3.1.0 released on 2014-04-12

2014-04-12  Petr Stehlik <pstehlik@sophics.cz>
* DOC/ChangeLog, DOC/NEWS: updated for new release

* README.1ST, atari800.spec, DOC/README, atari.h, atari800.man, configure.ac,
  util/export: version++


2014-04-05  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* cfg.c, mxpokeysnd.[ch], pokeysnd.[ch], sound.c, ui.c, configure.ac: Moved the
  SYNCHRONIZED_SOUND code made more generic and moved out of mzpokeysnd.c to
  pokeysnd.c. Now synchronized sound is supported by both pokey sound engines.

* colours_pal.c: Minor formatting & constness fixes.


2014-03-03  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* atari.c, atari_basic.c, atari_curses.c, atari_falcon.c, atari_ps2.c,
  atari_x11.c, amiga/amiga.c, dos/atari_vga.c, sdl/main.c,
  win32/atari_win32.c, win32/main.cpp, atari_wince.c Ensure that Sound_Exit()
  is called after config file is saved-on-exit, by moving the call to
  Sound_Exit() out of PLATFORM_Exit() and into Atari800_Exit(). Reason: When
  SOUND_THIN_API is enabled, autosaving after Sound_Exit would cause the
  config file's SOUND_ENABLED entry to always be written as 0.


2014-02-27  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* sdl/init.c, sdl/main.c: Avoid "undefined reference to PLATFORM_Time" linker
  error when configured --with-sound=sdl but --with-video != sdl.

* atari.c: Fixed a bug with keyboard input not working on --with-video=ncurses
  --with-audio=oss. On initialisation, Sound_enabled == TRUE but audio output
  is not yet initialised. In such situation calling
  sound_oss.c->PLATFORM_SoundSetup() would close standard input, thus disabling
  keyboard.


2014-02-19  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* cartridge.[ch], ui.c, android/jni/jni.c, atari800.man, DOC/cart.txt,
  DOC/USAGE, DOC/CREDITS: With Hias' help - documented behaviour of the XEGS
  cartridges more precisely. Also added a different variant of the XEGS 64 KB
  cartridge - both variants were manufactured by Atari.


2014-01-29  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* cartridge.[ch], ui.c, android/jni/jni.c, atari800.man, DOC/cart.txt,
  DOC/USAGE: Based on description by Hias, added minimal support for the 32
  and 64 MB variants of The!Cart.

* DOC/cart.txt: Added column that describes state of emulation support of
  the cartridge types. Also other fixes.


2014-01-26  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* dos/dos_sb.c: Bring indentation more into line with the apparent standard.

* dos/sound_dos.c, dos/dos_sb.[ch], configure.ac: Apply SOUND_THIN_API to DOS
  sound. Also fix two old bugs: pitch being wrong, and sound not working in
  one-shot mode (DSP 1.xx).

* sound.c, ui.c: Move code that stores current sound settings in Sound_desired
  - previously settings were stored only when changed from GUI, but not when
  changed from command line params.


2014-01-18  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* ui.c: Fix obvious mistake in System Settings, that lead to buffer overflow.

* cartridge.c, DOC/cart.txt, DOC/CREDITS: Fixes by Matthias Reichl for
  emulation of The!Cart.


2013-12-28  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* atari.c: Make turbo mode considerably faster, by avoiding pointless screen
  redraws.

* sdl/sound.c, sound.c: Fix stereo sound on SDL and -sound/-nosound parameters,
  broken when introducing SOUND_THIN_API.


2013-12-15  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* atari.c, util.[ch]: Atari_time and Atari_sleep renamed to Util_* and moved to
  util.c module - they are now used externally from atari.c.

* atari.c, cfg.c, platform.h, sound_oss.c, sound.[ch], ui.c,
  javanvm/atari800.java, javanvm/javanvm.h, javanvm/sound.c, sdl/sound.c,
  configure.ac, atari800.man, DOC/USAGE: Formerly SDL-specific support for
  synchronized sound moved to new module sound.c and made platform-independent.
  In effect, created a new thin API for platform-specific audio. Platforms that
  support SOUND_THIN_API will have thinner layer of platform-specific sound
  code and will support a common set of new functionality:
  - ability to build with --enable-synchronized_sound,
  - new UI Sound menu options for enabling/disabling sound, setting sample
    rate, choosing 8- or 16-bit sound, setting hardwares ound buffer size, and
    (with enabled synchronized_sound) setting sound latency,
  - saving these new options in config, and setting them from command line
    parameters.
  Currently SOUND_THIN_API is implemented for SDL, JavaNVM and OSS sound.


2013-12-14  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* javanvm/input.c: Map F12 to Turbo, as in other targets.


2013-12-08  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* binload.c: When no OS patches were enabled, Running of BASIC files would
  cause the emulated system to go sraight to Self Test: the calls to
  Device_PatchOS() would enable E: patches, but wouldn't disable the OS memory
  checks. Calling ESC_UpdatePatches() instead solves the issue.
* afile.c, atari.c, gtia.[ch]: Avoid sending Option and Start keystrokes to a 
  diagnostic cartridge when coldstarting.
* cartridge.[ch], ui.c, android/jni/jni.c, atari800.man, DOC/cart.txt,
  DOC/USAGE: Added support for the 2 MB MegaCart mapping.


2013-12-07  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* cartridge.[ch], atari800.man, DOC/cart.txt: Added support for a small subset
  of The!Cart mapping.
* cartridge.[ch]: CARTRIDGE_kb is not modified anywhere, made it const.


2013-12-04  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* cartridge.[ch], ui.c, android/jni/jni.c, atari800.man, DOC/cart.txt,
  DOC/USAGE: Added read-only support for the 4 MB Flash MegaCart mapping.


2013-12-02  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* cartridge.[ch], ui.c, android/jni/jni.c, atari800.man, DOC/cart.txt,
  DOC/USAGE: Added support for the MegaMax 2 MB cartridge mapping. Developers
  of The!Cart confirmed that the CART ID for the 64MB variant is not needed, so
  I've reused it.


2013-11-23  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* configure.ac, atari.c, platform.h, atari_ps2.c, sdl/main.c : Minimal cleanup
  of platform-specific Sleep/Time routines.


2013-11-11  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* monitor.c: Fixed & updated symbols based on OS & BASIC source listings.


2013-11-09  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* DOC/cart.txt: By request of the developers of The!Cart, reserved two IDs
  for this new cartridge type.


2013-05-02  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* DOC/INSTALL: Update NestedVM build manual - it doesn't build with
  --enable-ide.

* javanvm/atari_javanvm.c: Fix overflow of dsp_buffer - could happen on some
  systems where JAVANVM_SoundAvailable sometimes returns value larger than
  2*line_buffer_size.

* DOC/INSTALL, configure.ac, Makefile.in, javanvm/atari_javanvm.[ch],
  javanvm/input.[ch], javanvm/javanvm.h, javanvm/main.c, javanvm/sound.c,
  javanvm/video.[ch]: Code cleanup - split atari_javanvm.c to separate modules
  for video, sound and input. Merge javanvm and javanvm-basic targets into the
  default target - NestedVM host is now autodetected.


2013-04-28  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* Makefile.in: Use printf instead of echo -e - more portable (and -e didn't
  work on GNU Make 3.81).


2013-04-23  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* artifact.[ch], atari.c, atari800.man, cfg.c, configure.ac,
  pal_blending.[ch], ui.c, videomode.[ch], sdl/video_gl.c, sdl/video.sw.c,
  sdl/video.c, DOC/USAGE, amiga/makefile, dc/Makefile.dc,
  win32/msc/Makefile: New module, artifact.c, which manages settings of all
  artifacting modes. Artifacting modes are now stored independently for PAL
  and NTSC modes, and set according to the current TV mode setting.

* sdl/main.c, sdl/video.c: When in monitor, avoid reopening the SDL window
  during stepping through code.


2013-04-15  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* colours_pal.[ch], colours.[ch], configure.ac, pal_blending.[ch], platform.h,
  ui.c, sdl/palette.[ch], sdl/video_gl.[ch], sdl/video_sw.[ch], sdl.video.[ch]:
  Added accurate emulation of PAL delay line (PAL blending).


2013-04-08  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* antic.[ch], gtia.c, ui.c: Improve the existing PAL blending implementation,
  which worked only on lines in GTIA mode 9 and was erroneously called
  "GTIA11_DELAY". Previously it only blended lines placed below GTIA 11 lines,
  now it works on all grasycale pixels. PAL blending now can be switched
  on/off - see "Display settings->TV effect" (renamed from "NTSC artifacting
  quality", as this option is no longer NTSC-specific).


2013-04-07  Tomasz Krasuski  <kr0tki@poczta.onet.pl>
* colours_pal.c: More accurate emulation of PAL colours based on analysis of
  oscillograms of PAL GTIA output.

* cartridge.[ch], ui.c, atari800.man, DOC/cart.txt, DOC/USAGE: Added support
  for the cartridge mapping used by "Turbo Hit"/"Atari Blizzard Hit".

* memory.h: Fix gcc 4.7.2 -Wstrict-aliasing warnings.

* cartridge.[ch], ui.c, android/jni/jni.c: Avoid compiler warnings by moving
  the table of cartridge names to jni.c. The default target doesn't need that
  table anyway, it only needs the names.

* cartridge.c: Fix uninitialised variable which could result in unnecessary
  bank switching.


2013-03-21  Petr Stehlik <pstehlik@sophics.cz>
* configure.c, ui.c, atari_rpi.c, gles/video.c: committing new support
  for Raspberry Pi made by Andrey Dj

* DOC/README.RPI, DOC/BUILD.RPI: documentation added
