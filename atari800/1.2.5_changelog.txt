* ui.c:
  - applied patch from Ed Cogburn that fixes subsequent mounting
    of R/W disks in slot that was mounted R/O previously.
  - finally implemented the R/W <-> R/O mode switching using the Space Bar.
    Please note that this R/W <-> R/O switch is just temporary and does
    not change the writeprotect flag of ATR images. Besides, it cannot
    override this flag so you actually can't mount a writeprotected ATR
    image read/write using this Space Bar toggle.

* atari.c: Ken Ames sent me a very simple patch that is supposed to allow
    compiling the Atari800 on OS/2 "using Hob X11, XFree86, or IBM's X11
    server".
