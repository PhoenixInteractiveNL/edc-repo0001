2006-04-08  Petr Stehlik  <pstehlik@sophics.cz>

* antic.c: a bug in do_border_gtia10 caused a crash on machines that don't
  support unaligned words (problem reported by Mark Watson), on other machines
  sprites on the right border in GTIA 10 modes were incorrectly shifted;
  a pointer cast in DO_BORDER_1 replaced with IS_ZERO_ULONG, just in case

2006-01-30  Perry McFarlane  <perry_m@fastmail.fm>
* antic.c: fixes for Spider City and Fast Eddie
  Don't display usual graphics if DMACTL width changed from 0 past a
  certain cycle.  Also don't continue to steal cycles. Bug made Fast Eddie
  bounce up and down one scan line in the demo mode and caused garbage lines
  in Spider City.

* antic.c: fix update_scanline_* to adjust for HSCROL only when IR&0x10 is
  true.  I don't know if it caused any problems but it was wrong.

* antic.c: fix for Final Orbit. Set IR = 0 after JVB instruction.  Bug made the
  screen shake badly.


2006-01-26  Piotr Fusik  <fox@scene.pl>
* ui_basic.c: directory that has been left (via Backspace or "[..]")
  is highlighted in the parent directory; display an error message
