** 2.0.3 released on 2007-07-11

2007-04-23  Piotr Fusik  <fox@scene.pl>
* win32/msc/Makefile: fixed a problem that appeared when I switched to another
  version of NMAKE ("fatal error U1100: macro '$@' is illegal in the context
  of batch rule '.c.obj'")


2007-04-23  Paulo Lopes  <paulo.lopes@ist.utl.pt>
* win32/atari_win32.c: new command-line option "-win32keys" for keyboard
  layouts different from US (the emulator relies on Win32 API to do scan code
  translations)


2006-12-07  Paulo Lopes  <paulo.lopes@ist.utl.pt>
* win32/main.c, win32/screen_win32.[ch]: an option to run the emulator
  in a window ("-windowed" on the command line)


2006-11-05  Piotr Fusik  <fox@scene.pl>
* DOC/PORTING: an introduction to writing platform-specific part of Atari800


2006-10-31  Kostas Nakos  <knakos@gmail.com>
* util.c: Make sure user does not updir from the root in WinCE


2006-10-30  Kostas Nakos  <knakos@gmail.com>
* wince/port/*, ui_basic.c, DOC/INSTALL.wince: added support for QVGA landscape
  smartphones, added the virtual keyboard (kb_ui) and updated documentation.


2006-09-04  Piotr Fusik  <fox@scene.pl>
* cartridge.[ch], ui.c, DOC/cart.txt: added 128 KB SpartaDOS X cartridge type,
  by the way: shortened the cartridge code and replaced letters with numbers
  for bank indexing in the documentation


2006-07-23  Piotr Fusik  <fox@scene.pl>
* input.[ch], atari_x11.c, win32/main.c: middle button support
  for ST and Amiga mice


2006-07-21  Piotr Fusik  <fox@scene.pl>
* antic.c: corrected PMG in bizarre ANTIC/GTIA modes


2006-07-01  Mark Grebe  <markgrebe@yahoo.com>
* antic.[ch], ui.c: new style of artifacting


2006-06-29  Piotr Fusik  <fox@scene.pl>
* win32/msc/Makefile, win32/msc/config.h, DOC/INSTALL:
  upgraded VC++ from 6.0 to 2005


2006-05-01  Piotr Fusik  <fox@scene.pl>
* util/act2html.*: replaced my old C program with a Perl script;
  the Perl script keeps hues from different palettes together
  which I think is better for palette comparisons

* util/colors.asx, util/colors.xex: Atari program that displays all 256 colors

* util/crlf.*, util/keyboard.txt, util/usage2html.pl: removed

* util/readme.txt: updated

* act/gray.act: 0x00,0x11,0x22,... instead of 0x00,0x10,0x20,...


2006-04-24  Piotr Fusik  <fox@scene.pl>
* util/sethdr.pl, util/sethdr.txt: removed; the script hasn't been updated
  for years (so it supported only half of current cartridge types),
  wasn't portable, etc. "Create Cartridge from ROM image" in the emulator
  basically does the job of the removed script.

* util/makebb.bat: removed; anyone who is serious about making a ROM image
  of "Bounty Bob Strikes Back 5200" by concatenating 3 files can read
  DOC/cart.txt
