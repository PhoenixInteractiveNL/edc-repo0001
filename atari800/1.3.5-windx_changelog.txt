* atari_x11.c: Ken Zalewski contributed a patch for keyboard handling
  that fixes a segfault (XLookupString was called even if the event
  was not keyboard related).

* atari_x11.c: after looking into the keyboard handling under X11
  I realized that keyboard auto-repeat was not working at all.
  I tried to fix it by keeping the keycode status persistent.
  It seems to work in non-XVIEW/non-MOTIF version.

* atari_sdl.c: Daniel Serpell contributed a patch for keyboard handling
  that makes the Atari800 keyboard working on non-US keyboard layouts
  simply by using the Unicode values of the keys (instead of scancodes).
  Also, keys Control-0 to 9 and Control-A to Z were added. The "Atari"
  key is mapped to the left Windows key, the Caps-toggle key is mapped
  to the right Windows key and the Atari Shift+F1 and Shift+F2 keys
  are mapped to host's PageUp and PageDown keys (as this is the function
  of those keys in the Atari-XL OS).
