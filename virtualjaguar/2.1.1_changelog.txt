Virtual Jaguar v2.1.1 GCC/Qt
----------------------------

* Added controller profiles. What this means is that if you left your gamepad
  behind and/or have a different one, VJ will let you create a controller
  config for the new controller without destroying the old one. This also means
  that if you have *no* controllers, you can still play VJ with the keyboard.

* Fixed a few problems with the DSP a timing; as a result, the sound in Rayman
  and the FACTS demo is correct now. [Shamus]
* Removed toolbar from full screen mode. [Shamus]
* Added analog inputs to gamepad support. [Shamus]
* Fixed 6MB cartridge space access limitation. 6MB carts should work now.
