Virtual Jaguar v1.0.5 GCC/SDL
-----------------------------

* Various fixes to the codebase so that it compiles and works properly on
  Linux. :-) The makefiles are almost identical now, the only thing that's
  different between them are the SYSTYPE and EXESUFFIX variables defined at
  the top. [Shamus]
* Fixed a pernicious blitter bug that kept Rayman from doing proper collision
  detection. [Shamus]
* Added a simple file selector so that typing in long filenames in order to
  run the emulator is no longer necessary. :-) To use it, instead of
  supplying a ROM name, simply put in the name of the directory where your
  ROMs live. [Shamus]
* Removed all the assembly language code from the DSP, so it should be a
  little less buggy now. Also, removed some brain-dead timeslice releasing
  that was causing a bunch of problems with various ROMs. [Shamus]
* Added sound support! In order to hear any sound, you probably have to
  start VJ with the -dspon switch. Also, unless you have a very fast computer
  the sound is going to be choppy. Hopefully future optimizations will cure
  this. ;-) [Shamus]
* Added GUI support. You can see the results by hitting the TAB key while the
  emulator is running. ;-) [Shamus]
* Lots of cleanups to the source code including the ability to trace who
  writes what to where. [Shamus]
