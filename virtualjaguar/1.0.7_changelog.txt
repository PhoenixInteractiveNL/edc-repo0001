Virtual Jaguar v1.0.7 GCC/SDL
-----------------------------

* Various fixes to make for smoother compilation on MacOS. [Adam Green]
* Fixes to filetype parsing. VJ now properly recognizes .abs, .jag, .rom,
  and .j64 files--be sure to check the README for the gory details! [Shamus]
* Added a kludge to allow homebrew demos to run without a Stubulator ROM and
  without crashing the emulator. [Shamus]
* Fixed a blitter intensity addition problem. This fixes the title in Hover
  Strike and the road/shadows in Checkered Flag. [Shamus]
* Partially fixed a problem with the SUBC opcode in the RISC processors. This
  allows Hover Strike, Phase Zero and Fight For Life to boot into their title
  screens and makes them somewhat playable. [Shamus]
* Fixed a horizontal scaling problem in the OP and the off-by-one bug that it
  reintroduced. This fixes the road in Atari Karts and probably a few others.
  [Shamus]
* Fixed a long standing blitter bug that kept certain doors in AvP from
  rendering correctly. [Shamus]
* Fixed some vertical positioning bugs in the OP. Now Checkered Flag, Alien
  vs Predator and probably others now work as they should (graphically ;-)
  [Caz]
* Better GUI support. Most options in the GUI work now, and more are expected
  to be functional in the near future. [Shamus]
* Fixed a few more lingering blitter bugs (there are more to be found). This
  fixes most of the glitches in Cybermorph and Alien vs Predator. [Shamus]
* Fixed an Object Processor scaled bitmap bug that caused incorrect
  positioning of scaled bitmaps that started outside the line buffer, and
  also fixed a problem that caused the OP to hang in certain situations. This
  fixes Bubsy, International Sensible Soccer, and probably a few others.
  [Shamus]
* Cleaned up various bits of video rendering related code. [nwagenaar]
* Added support for OpenGL textures with a depth of 16bpp, 24bpp or 32bpp.
  [nwagenaar]
* Rewrote several OpenGL related rendering code concerning the new OpenGL
  texture depths and texture sizes. [nwagenaar]
* Rewrote several OpenGL rendering functions concerning speed related items.
  [nwagenaar]
* Several bugs resolved due to OpenGL and normal rendering code. [nwagenaar]
* Default resolution for OpenGL is now 640x480. [nwagenaar]
