Virtual Jaguar v2.0.0 GCC/Qt
----------------------------

* Switched GUI to Qt. And there was much rejoicing. ;-) [Shamus]
* Added detection code to fish out files from inside ZIP archives. What this
  means is that now you can have other goodies inside of your ROM ZIP like
  labels, box art, and overlays. See built-in help for details. [Shamus]
* Various usability improvements, too many to list here. ;-) [Shamus]
* Various compatibility improvements to the Jaguar core, too many to list
  here. ;-) [Shamus]
