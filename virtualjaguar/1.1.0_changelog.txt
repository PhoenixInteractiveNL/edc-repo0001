Virtual Jaguar v1.1.0 GCC/SDL (r299 - Never officially released)
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Switched OpenGL rendering to 32 BPP. This is not only how a real Jaguar
  renders graphics, but it also gives VJ a nice speed boost. ;-) [Shamus]
* Changed execution to a time-based solution so that timers and IRQs and
  such can happen when they're supposed to. [Shamus]
* Fixed blitter writes so that Intensity[0-3] and Z[0-3] are written in the
  correct order. [Shamus]
* Major rewrite of blitter to conform the the TOM ASIC nets. This should fix a
  bunch of stuff that wasn't working correctly before. [Shamus]
* Fixed writes to 64 bit blitter registers. [Shamus]
* Refactored GUI to be more maintainable, better looking and more responsive.
