[Comment]

This version maybe the end of the old classic Gens.So I give it a 
code name 'Souvenir'.it's a glory that I can help stef to update 
this version.I was thought that copy more codes form Gens32 to make 
this version more powerful.But finally,I just change a little.I keep 
Gens as Gens.Because I know,that good old days is more important 
then a emulator itself.You know,I have completely rewrite Gens32 3 
times.But all of the 3 editons was based on Stef's Gens.Because I just 
know that the Gens is a good emulator.

Forgive me for my poor Englsih.
