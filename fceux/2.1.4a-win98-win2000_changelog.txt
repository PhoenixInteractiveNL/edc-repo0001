What's New? 2.1.4 (changelog)
Released 01 June 2010

2.1.4 is a maintenance release that fixes these bugs in 2.1.4:

fix crash bug on .fcm convert

fix erroneous reporting of savestate past the end of movie error during read-only loadstates




Released 31 May 2010







The 2.1.4 release fixes many bugs and adds new features compared to 2.1.3. In addition it also fixes up the movie code significantly; fixing implementation problems, loading speed, adding new features, and fixing bugs. 




Common 

Added microphone support option. When enabled, Port 2 Start activates the Microphone 
Prevent .zip files containing no recognized files from causing crash 
Autohold - Added player 3 and 4 to autohold notification window, labeled controller input 
mapper 19 savestate fix mirroring for "Dream Master (J)" corrected to "four-screen" by CRC check 
Disable auto-savestates during turbo 
Fixed so Gotcha! auto-enables the zapper 
Autohold - Added player 3 and 4 to autohold notification window, labeled controller input 



Movies




Fully implemented "bulletproof" read-only 
Movie code now fully conforms to the Savestate section of the Laws of TAS 
Fixed a potential desync that plays out an extra frame without an update to the frame count involving heavy lua use, joypad.get, and a loadstate 
Movie support for microphone 
Movies now have a "finished" mode.  If a playback stops the movie isn't cleared from memory, and can be replayed or a state loaded Similar functionality as DeSmuME and GENS rerecording 
New PPU flag in movie headers (doesn't change an emulators PPU state when loading a movie) 
Much faster movie loading and movie-savestate loading 
Made gamepad 2 off by default (so less movies should have unused player 2 data) 
Implemented a "full savestate-movie load" mode similar to the implementation in VBA-rr and SNES9x-rr.  In this mode loading a savestate in read+write doesn't truncate the movie to its frame count immediately.  Instead it waits until input is recording into the movie (next frame).  For win32 this feature is togglable in movie options and the context menu.  For SDL this is off by default and a toggle will need to be added 
Movie + loadstate errors are handled more gracefully now, with more informative error messages and the movie doesn't have to stop if backups are enabled 
Fix PlayMovieFromBeginning when using a movie that starts from savestate 



Lua

fix bug that caused zapper.read() to crash when movie playback ends 
Win32 - Added option for palette selection as color for LUA colors. Included is a LUA script to display all choices with the value used to pick displayed color 



New Lua functions

movie.ispoweron() 
movie.isfromsavestate() 
emu.addgamegenie() 
emu.delgamegenie() 
savestate.object() which is savestate.create() with intuitive numbering under windows 
gui.getpixel() which gets any gui.pixel() set pixel colors, and possibly other functions 
emu.getscreenpixel() which gets the RGB and Palette of any pixel on the screen 
lua function movie.getfilename() which returns the current movie filename without the path included 



Input Display

Input display updates on loadstate 
Input display overhaul that uses different colors for different input contexts 
Input display now shows both currently pressed buttons and buttons held the previous frame 



Win32

Added NTSC 2x scalar option with some CFG config options of it's own Added Ram Search hotkeys for the first 6 search types in the list 
Add Cheat buttons for Ram Search and Ram Watch 
With special scaler in window mode, it's possible to resize to anything above the minimum. 
Recording a new movie adds it to recent movies list 
Replay dialog, when selecting a movie in a relative path (.\movies for example), the recent movies list stores an absolute path instead 
Replay dialog shows PAL flag and New PPU flags 
CDLogger - fixed bug preventing correct interrupt vectors from logging 
Memwatch - ignore spaces at the beginnign of an address in the address boxes 
Replay dialog - fix bug that was causing it to always report savestate movies as soft-reset 



Debugger




Added conditional debugging option 'K', for bank PC is on 
Fixed bug involving pausing emulation outside of the debugger, then trying to use the debugger commands, and having the CPU registers become corrupted 
Made debugger able to break on and distinguish Stack reads/writes 



Hex Editor




Added "Goto" command 
Made the Hex Editor display the Frozen, Bookmarked, etc. status of the selected address, and made the Frozen color override the Bookmarked color. 



Cheat Search




Made enabling/disabling cheats no longer deselect the selected cheat 
Added context menu to Cheat Dialog Cheat Listbox, populated list with Toggle Cheat, Poke Cheat Value, and Goto In Hex Editor 
Enabled multi-select for Cheat menu to allow multiple toggles and deletes 
Made cheat menu's Pause When Active effect immediate 



GUI




Added Tools - GUI option to partially disable visual themes, so the emulator can be made to look like it did in 2.1.1 and earlier releases. Drag & Drop - if dropping a .fcm with no ROM loaded, prompt for one (same functionality that was added to .fm2 files) 
Added single-instance mode, which makes starting a second copy of FCEUX load the file into the first, then exit.Mode off by default, togglable under Config - GUI
