What's New? 2.0.0

Released August 02, 2008




FCEUX has all the latest tools, enhancements, and features from FCEU 0.28 rerecording and FCEUXDSP 1.07  In addition, it has many new tools, bug fixes, and enhancements not seen in previous branches.







General




-A detailed Help Menu!  No longer are you aimlessly searching the internet for long lost info on FCEU's options!

-Numerous Dialog box reformats.

-FCEU remembers its last screen (x,y) position.

-Increased command line options

-More options under the Directory Override Menu

-A Turbo Toggle option (turbo now can be toggled on rather than having to hold the key down)

-More hotkey assignable options in the Map Hotkeys Menu.

-A lag counter

-Autofire uses the lag counter (so it will skip over lag frames)







Movie support




Overhauls in both the movie and savestate file formats.




.fm2 File format




The .fcm file format has been overhauled into a new .fm2 format.  Changes include:




-Uncompressed and text based format.  Movie editing can be done simply in a text editor.

-Recording from soft reset option removed.

-Recording from start (hard reset) no longer has an empty savestate at the beginning.

-GUID inserted into movies for better savestate/loadstate error handling.

-Rather than an Author field, it has a full metadata menu where an author can put any info needed.

-A tool to convert .fcm files to .fm2 files.

-More specific info on .fm2 files in the .fm2 documentation. 




Savestate/Loadstate




-New savestate file format.  NOTE:  Savestates from previous FCEU versions CAN NOT be used in FCEUX.

-Fully functional error handling (savestates from other movies cannot be loaded).

-Read-only toggling related bugs fixed.

-Savestate filenames include the name of the movie (if a movie was playing when made).  This prevents loading wrong savestates. (This also means that savestate 0 is different when a movie is playing and when it is not).




7z Archive Support




-ROMs in any 7z compatible compressed format can be opened directly.

-If more than one valid ROM exists in an archive file, then a dialog box will open with a list of available ROM choices.
